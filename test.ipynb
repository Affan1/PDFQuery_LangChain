At Spring Budget 2023 the government is \\nbuilding on this foundation, with a plan to deliver on three of the five key priorities \\nset out by the Prime Minister in January: to halve inflation, grow the economy and \\nget debt falling. \\nHalving inflation\\nPutin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and global supply chain pressures have \\npushed wholesale energy prices to record highs and saw inflation peak at 11.1% in \\nOctober 2022, the highest level in 40 years. High inflation erodes the value of wages \\nand hurts economic growth. \\nThe Bank of England has taken steps to control inflation by raising interest rates, \\nand the government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) has reduced energy bills for \\nmillions, keeping inflation lower than it otherwise would be. The Office for Budget \\nResponsibility (OBR) is now forecasting that Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation \\nwill fall to 2.9% by the end of 2023. \\nTo further support households with the cost of living, the government is \\nmaintaining the EPG at £2,500 for a further three months from April 2023. The \\ngovernment will also align charges for comparable direct debit and Pre-Payment \\nMeter (PPMs) customers, ensuring that those on PPMs no longer pay a premium \\nfor their energy costs. \\nTo increase resilience to future energy price shocks, the government is supporting \\ninvestment in the energy system by launching Great British Nuclear to support \\nnew nuclear builds, making up to £20 billion available for Carbon Capture, \\nUtilisation and Storage (CCUS), and extending the Climate Change Agreement \\nscheme for a further two years to encourage energy efficiency. \\nHouseholds are facing price rises beyond energy costs. The government will spend \\nover £5 billion maintaining fuel duty at current levels for the next 12 months, \\nincluding keeping the 5p cut in place. The government is also increasing Draught \\nRelief from 1 August to freeze the duty charged on a typical pint of beer in the pub \\nand ensure this will always be lower than in the supermarket. Reforms to childcare \\nwill also help families with children with one of the most significant costs they face. 2 Spring Budget 2023Overall, the government is providing a total of £94 billion, equivalent to £3,300 per \\nhousehold on average, across this financial year and next, to support households \\nwith higher costs. \\nGrowing the economy\\nEconomic growth increases living standards, supports higher paid jobs, and \\nstrengthens the public finances. Spring Budget begins to implement the \\nChancellor’s strategy to deliver long term sustainable growth, focusing on four key \\npriorities: Employment, Education, Enterprise and Everywhere. The OBR is now \\nforecasting the UK economy will avoid a recession and, supported by action taken \\nat the Spring Budget, GDP is higher in the medium term.\\nIncreasing employment  raises living standards and helps businesses grow. While \\nunemployment is at a near 50-year low, since the COVID-19 pandemic there has \\nbeen a significant increase in the number of people neither in nor looking for work, \\nwith 6.7 million of the working age population economically inactive, excluding \\nstudents. Spring Budget announces a comprehensive employment package \\nfocused on four groups: the long-term sick and disabled, welfare recipients and the \\nunemployed, older workers, and parents. The OBR expects this package to result in \\n110,000 more individuals in the labour market by the end of the forecast period.\\nThere are more than 2.5 million people reporting that they are inactive due to long-\\nterm sickness. To help remove the barriers to employment this group faces, the \\ngovernment is introducing a Universal Support programme in England and Wales \\nto match people with disabilities and long-term sickness with jobs and provide \\nsupport and training to help them succeed. Spring Budget also introduces a suite \\nof measures to address the leading causes of ill health related inactivity, including \\ntailored employment support in mental health and musculoskeletal health \\nservices, and expanding access to digital resources and health checks. \\nThere are currently 5.9 million Universal Credit claimants. Many are out of work \\nor on low earnings and could be contributing more to the economy and earning \\nhigher wages. The government is therefore providing additional support to help \\nUniversal Credit claimants find employment or increase their hours, by increasing \\nWork Coach support and work search requirements, and strengthening support for \\nclaimants that are carers of children. \\nWorkers aged over 50 left the labour market in the greatest numbers during the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. To encourage this group to extend their working lives, the \\ngovernment is increasing tax relief on pensions. The Lifetime Allowance charge \\nwill be removed from April 2023 before the Allowance is abolished entirely from \\nApril 2024, and the Annual Allowance will be raised to £60,000. These reforms \\nwill help ensure that high skilled individuals such as NHS clinicians are not \\ndisincentivised from remaining in the workforce.3 Spring Budget 2023There are around 435,000 people in England with a child under 3 who are inactive \\ndue to their caring responsibilities; many of these people report that they would \\nlike to work but cannot afford childcare. The government is significantly expanding \\nthe support on offer by providing 30 hours a week of free childcare for 38 weeks \\na year, for eligible working parents of children aged 9 months to 3 years. This will \\nbe rolled out in phases from April 2024 and is in addition to the 30 hours a week \\nalready provided for eligible working parents of 3 to 4-year-olds. The government \\nwill also provide £204 million in 2023-24, increasing to £288 million in 2024-25, to \\nsubstantially uplift the hourly funding rate paid to providers to deliver the existing \\nfree hours offers in England. \\nAs a result of these reforms, the government is providing free childcare for eligible \\nworking parents of children from 9 months until they start school. This will help \\nwith the cost of living, support education for the youngest children, and remove \\none of the biggest barriers to parents working. \\nThe government is also launching a new wraparound pathfinder scheme to \\nsupport the expansion of school-based childcare provision either side of the school \\nday. Support for childcare costs in Universal Credit will be made available upfront \\nand the maximum potential benefit for parents will be increased. \\nThe government will ensure that the UK labour market has access to skills \\nand talent from abroad where needed. To help ease immediate labour supply \\npressures, the government will accept the Migration Advisory Committee’s \\n(MAC) interim recommendations to add five construction occupations to the \\nShortage Occupation List (SOL) initially, ahead of its wider SOL review concluding \\nin autumn 2023.\\nEducation  gives people the knowledge and skills they need to get the jobs they \\nwant, helping turn the UK into a high skill, high wage economy. The government \\nhas already committed to maths to 18 and is rolling out T Levels, Skills Bootcamps \\nand the Lifelong Loan Entitlement, which will have a transformative impact on \\npost-18 education, giving people the opportunity to study, retrain and upskill \\nthroughout their working lives. Spring Budget introduces Returnerships: a new \\noffer targeted at the over-50s, which brings together existing skills programmes, \\nsupported by £63 million of additional funding. \\nAn enterprise -focused economy is one that attracts and supports the most \\ndynamic and productive companies. The UK has one of the most competitive \\nbusiness tax regimes in the world, with the headline rate of Corporation Tax \\ncontinuing to be the lowest among G7 economies. Spring Budget goes further \\nby introducing full expensing for 3 years from 1 April 2023. During this period, \\ncompanies across the UK will be able to write off the full cost of qualifying plant \\nand machinery investment in the year they invest, supporting businesses to invest \\nand grow. The government intends to make this measure permanent when fiscal \\nconditions allow. 4 Spring Budget 2023To help encourage innovation in the economy, Spring Budget announces further \\nsupport for R&D intensive Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), via an \\nenhanced rate of tax relief for loss making companies; and for the UK’s world \\nleading creative industries, through increased audio-visual tax reliefs.\\nAt Autumn Statement 2022 the government asked Sir Patrick Vallance to lead \\nthe Pro-innovation Regulation of Technologies Review. The government is \\ntaking forward all Sir Patrick’s recommendations on the regulation of emerging \\ndigital technologies, published alongside Spring Budget. Based on Sir Patrick’s \\ninterim findings on life sciences, the government is providing extra funding for \\nthe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to help it \\nmaximise use of its Brexit freedoms and accelerate patient access to treatments. \\nThe government has now asked Sir Patrick to report on how regulators can better \\nsupport innovation, and the government’s new Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor \\nDame Angela McLean, will oversee future reviews into creative industries, advanced \\nmanufacturing, and the regulator growth duty. \\nStability is key to providing an environment for economic growth. As recent events \\nconcerning Silicon Valley Bank have demonstrated, clear economic and financial \\nstability frameworks are vital to deal with macroeconomic volatility and potential \\nshocks effectively. \\nLevelling up means spreading opportunity everywhere . The UK’s spatial disparities \\nin productivity are large compared to other advanced economies, and there \\nis significant untapped growth potential outside of London. Spring Budget \\nintroduces a package of measures to spread growth across the UK and give local \\nleadership the tools to deliver for their areas. \\nSpring Budget launches the refocused Investment Zones programme to catalyse 12 \\ngrowth clusters across the UK, including four across Scotland, Wales and Northern \\nIreland. Each cluster will drive growth in key future sectors and bring investment \\nto the local area. Each English Investment Zone will have access to interventions \\nworth £80 million over five years, including tax reliefs and grant funding. \\nSpring Budget delivers on the Levelling Up White Paper by providing new and \\ndeeper powers to more local leaders. Trailblazer deals have been agreed with the \\nGreater Manchester and West Midlands Combined Authorities which will give \\nthem greater control over local transport, skills, employment, housing, innovation \\nand net zero priorities, as well as single funding settlements at the next Spending \\nReview. The government will also negotiate a new wave of devolution deals with \\nareas across England, which will include local investment funding for areas that are \\ncommitted to electing a mayor or leader. \\nSpring Budget also announces the roll out of new Levelling Up Partnerships, \\nproviding over £400 million of investment in 20 areas across England. The \\ngovernment is also providing additional funding for local projects to encourage \\ngrowth and support communities, including: over £200 million for 16 high quality \\nregeneration projects, £200 million for local authorities to repair potholes and 5 Spring Budget 2023improve roads, over £100 million of support for local charities and community \\norganisations, and over £60 million for public swimming pool providers to help with \\nimmediate cost pressures and make facilities more energy efficient. \\nGetting debt falling\\nThe government had to increase borrowing in recent years to support households \\nand businesses through the COVID-19 pandemic and energy crisis. Public debt \\nnow stands at almost £2.5 trillion, or 98.9% of GDP. While the public finances have \\nproven more resilient than expected in November, higher inflation has increased \\nthe cost of servicing debt, with debt interest spending totalling £96 billion between \\nApril 2022 and January 2023. \\nAutumn Statement 2022 set out a clear plan to get debt falling as a share of \\nthe economy in the medium term. The latest forecast from the OBR confirms \\nthe government is on track to achieve this aim, with the debt to GDP fiscal rule \\nmet in 2027-28 with headroom of £6.5 billion and borrowing falling in every year \\nof the forecast. \\nThe government is providing additional support for public services, including \\n£5 billion for defence and national security priorities over the next two years, and \\n£2 billion each year for defence for the remainder of the forecast period. As set out \\nin the Integrated Review Refresh, the government’s aspiration over the longer term \\nis to invest 2.5% of GDP in defence, as the fiscal and economic circumstances allow. \\nThe government will continue to spend responsibly and identify efficiency savings \\nin day-to-day budgets to help manage pressures from higher inflation and focus \\nspending on key public services and government priorities. \\nThrough these measures the Spring Budget builds on the action taken at Autumn \\nStatement 2022 to halve inflation, grow the economy and get debt falling; to \\nsupport businesses and households with the cost of living; and underpin the UK’s \\nlong-term prosperity. 6 Spring Budget 2023Spring Budget 20239 Spring Budget 20231Economic and \\nfiscal\\xa0context \\nOverview\\n1.1 Supported by government decisions taken at Autumn Statement 2022, the \\neconomy and public finances have proved more resilient than expected in the Office \\nfor Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) November 2022 forecast. Spring Budget 2023 \\ntakes further action to deliver on three of the Prime Minister’s five priorities: halving \\ninflation, growing the economy, and getting debt falling. The OBR’s latest forecast \\nshows that inflation will more than halve this year, the economy is on track to avoid \\nrecession with gross domestic product (GDP) higher, and debt falling in the medium \\nterm (Table 1.1).1 \\nTable 1.1 Economic priorities\\nPriority On track to be met?\\nHalving InflationYes: The OBR forecasts Consumer Prices Index (CPI) Inflation in Q4 2023 \\nwill be less than half the level it was in Q4 2022, then return sustainably to target in the medium term.\\nGrowing the EconomyYes: The OBR forecasts the UK economy will avoid a recession and, \\nsupported by action taken at the Spring Budget, GDP is higher in the \\nmedium term.\\nDebt FallingYes: The OBR forecasts debt as a share of GDP will fall in 2027-28 and will \\nbe lower in every year than expected in the OBR’s November forecast.\\n1.2 While the UK economy’s performance has improved compared to the OBR’s \\nNovember forecast,2 significant challenges remain. Inflationary pressures, initially \\ndriven by global factors, have become widespread across the economy, weighing \\non household incomes and dragging on growth. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, \\nhigher interest rates, coupled with slowing economic growth, have hit the public \\nfinances, against a backdrop of higher levels of government debt. Furthermore, \\nstructural factors – including low business investment and increased labour market \\ninactivity – have dragged on growth and likely pushed up inflation.\\n1.3 The Spring Budget addresses these challenges. In the short term, the \\ngovernment is striking a balance between providing necessary help to households, businesses and the economy, and supporting the Bank of England to reduce inflation. The OBR forecasts the economy will avoid a recession and that government decisions are expected to help inflation fall more quickly this \\nyear. Over the medium term, the Spring Budget delivers an ambitious package \\nto support higher growth, by boosting business investment and labour market \\nactivity, while getting debt falling in line with the government’s fiscal rules. \\n1 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, March 2023.\\n2 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, November 2022.10 Spring Budget 2023Measures in the Spring Budget deliver the largest permanent increase in \\npotential GDP the OBR have ever scored in a medium-term forecast as a result of \\ngovernment policy. Over the longer term, the UK’s strong fundamentals and the \\ngovernment’s plan – built on the four pillars of employment, education, enterprise \\nand everywhere – should promote stronger, sustainable growth. \\nInflation\\nInflation has peaked and is starting to come down, but \\nremains high and has become more broad-based\\n1.4 Over 2022, both Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and global supply chain \\npressures pushed CPI inflation to 40-year highs as energy prices rose to record \\nlevels.3 Domestic inflation has also risen over the last year, with price rises becoming \\nmore broad-based (Box 1.A). Inflation peaked in October 2022 at 11.1% before falling \\nto 10.1% in January 2023.4 Inflation has been lower than the OBR expected in its \\nNovember 2022 forecast; wholesale energy prices in 2023 are now forecast to be \\n£1.50 per therm, less than half the £3.40 per therm assumed at the November 2022 \\nforecast, and supply chain pressures have continued to ease. Despite this, inflation \\nremains elevated across advanced economies.5 \\n1.5 The Bank of England have noted that the labour market remains tight and \\ndomestic price and wage pressures have been stronger than expected, suggesting \\nrisks of greater persistence in underlying inflation.6 Whole economy regular pay \\ngrowth is 6.5%.7 This level of pay growth is not consistent with returning CPI \\ninflation sustainably to the 2% target.\\nBox 1.A Inflation has fallen from its peak, but domestically \\ngenerated price pressures remain elevated\\nUK CPI inflation has risen sharply since mid-2021, primarily driven by global \\nfactors, reaching 11.1% in October last year.a These external pressures have eased in \\nrecent months. Disruption in global supply chains has dissipated, which has been \\nvisible in indicators such as lower global shipping pricesb and shorter delivery \\ntimes for suppliers.c This has helped UK goods price inflation fall. In addition, the \\nintroduction of the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) and Energy Bill Relief Scheme \\nhas limited energy inflation for households and businesses.d \\n3 UK Natural gas (NBP), Bloomberg (FN1 Comdty), March 2023.\\n4 Consumer price inflation, UK: January 2023 , Office for National Statistics, February 2023.\\n5 Consumer price indices , OECD, 2023\\n6 Monetary Policy Report , Bank of England, February 2023.\\n7 UK Labour Market: March 2023 , Office for National Statistics, March 2023. 11 Spring Budget 2023As external pressures have begun to subside, domestic inflationary pressures – \\nreflecting the balance of domestic supply and demand in the economy – have \\nrisen. In the UK, these domestic pressures stem from a tight labour market, \\nputting upward pressure on wages, and elevated inflation feeding through \\ninto wage and price setting. Services price inflation – an indicator of domestic \\ninflation – has risen sharply over the past year (Chart 1.1), and is well above its \\nhistorical average. Similarly, those items in the CPI basket with supply chains that \\nare the least dependent on imports – therefore relatively shielded from external \\nconditions – have also seen large increases in inflation rates which are yet to ease, \\nas have items with historically lower price volatility. Together, these trends indicate \\nthat domestic inflationary pressure is elevated. \\nChart 1.1: Measures of domestically generated inﬂation\\nSource: Ofﬁce for National Statistics and HM Treasury calculations.Items with the lowest import intensity Services Items with the lowest volatilityPercentage change on a year earlier\\n012345678\\nJan 2023 Sep 2022 May 2022 Jan 2022 Sep 2021 May 2021 Jan 2021 Sep 2020 May 2020 Jan 2020\\nThe shift from external to domestic pressures increases the risk that inflation stays \\nhigh for longer. A longer period of high inflation would eat further into wages, \\neroding living standards and hindering economic growth. It could also entrench \\nelevated inflation expectations, which in turn could generate more domestic \\ninflationary pressure. This highlights the importance of the government’s \\ncommitment to tackle inflation.  The Bank of England’s independent Monetary \\nPolicy Committee (MPC) has also noted this risk and continues to take action \\nto mitigate it.\\na Consumer price inflation, UK: January 2023 , Office for National Statistics, February 2023.\\nb World Container Index , Drewry, March 2023.\\nc Manufacturing PMI , S&P Global / CIPS, March 2023.\\nd Consumer price inflation , UK: January 2023 , Office for National Statistics, February 2023.12 Spring Budget 2023The government is supporting the independent Monetary \\nPolicy Committee to tackle inflation\\n1.6 The MPC has responded to rising inflation by tightening monetary policy, \\nincluding by raising Bank Rate to 4.0%; and will continue to adjust policy to meet its \\n2% inflation target.8 Monetary policy is the most effective tool to fight high inflation \\nand the MPC has a strong track record of delivering price stability.9 At Autumn \\nStatement 2022, the Chancellor reaffirmed – and committed not to change – the \\nBank’s 2% CPI inflation target.10 \\n1.7 Globally, rising interest rates, necessary to control inflation, have had significant \\nimplications for financial markets, resulting in heightened volatility, particularly in \\nmid-March 2023. UK banks are well placed to deal with this volatility, supported by \\nregulatory reforms since the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis. The Bank of England \\nconducts regular stress tests on major UK banks to ensure their ability to weather \\neconomic shocks, and the wider UK banking system remains safe, sound, and well \\ncapitalised. Recently, the Bank of England, with the support of the government, \\nused its resolution powers to safely manage the sale of Silicon Valley Bank UK Ltd \\n(SVBUK) to HSBC UK Bank plc, which has protected SVBUK customers’ deposits at \\nno expense to the taxpayer.\\n1.8 High and volatile inflation must be brought to an end because it hurts \\neconomic growth, disrupts decision-making for households and businesses, and \\nerodes living standards. More persistent inflationary pressures would require the \\nMPC to increase interest rates further and hold them higher for longer. While this \\nwould be necessary to deal with inflation, it would push up borrowing costs and \\nhold back growth. \\n1.9 The government’s policy decisions are supporting the MPC. In the autumn, the \\ngovernment took difficult but necessary decisions to limit borrowing and get the \\npublic finances under control. This better aligned fiscal policy with monetary policy, \\nwhich has promoted macroeconomic stability.\\n1.10 Decisions at the Spring Budget strike the appropriate balance between \\nsupporting the MPC with its objectives, helping households and businesses in \\nthe short term, and focusing on sustainable growth and reducing the deficit in \\nthe medium term (Box 1.B). The EPG is supporting households and has reduced \\npeak inflation. The OBR has said that the EPG reduced peak CPI inflation by \\n2.5 percentage points,11 and measures at the Spring Budget – extending the \\nEPG, freezing fuel duty and changes to alcohol duty – lower CPI inflation by 0.7 \\npercentage points in 2023-24.12 \\n8 Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting , Bank of England, February \\n2023.\\n9 HM Treasury calculations using Consumer price inflation, UK: January 2023 , Office for National Statistics, February \\n2023.\\n10 Autumn Statement 2022 , HM Treasury, November 2022.\\n11 Economic and Fiscal Outlook , Office for Budget Responsibility, November 2022.\\n12 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, March 2023.13 Spring Budget 2023Box 1.B How fiscal policy is supporting lower inflation, higher \\ngrowth and debt falling\\nFiscal policy decisions are balancing the need to support households and \\nbusinesses while helping the MPC bring inflation back to target and maintaining \\nfiscal sustainability. Across recent fiscal events, policy decisionsa have provided \\nsignificant near-term support for households, businesses, and the economy, \\nwhich is being withdrawn as the economy returns to stronger growth rates. Given \\nthe generous level of support, the government has taken the difficult decisions \\nto keep overall costs down and ensure debt is falling over the medium term. \\nThe Spring Budget contains an ambitious package of measures (see Table 4.1) \\nto support sustainable and non-inflationary growth, which results in the largest \\npermanent increase in potential GDP the OBR has ever scored in their medium-\\nterm forecast as a result of government policy.\\nChart 1.2 shows how fiscal policy delivers the Prime Minister’s priorities, through \\nthe lens of borrowing measures. Headline borrowing rose to 6.1% of GDP in \\n2022 -23, a historically high level,b substantially driven by debt servicing costs.

Business investment has been uneven and weak since the \\npandemic, and despite growth in the last quarter, has only just returned to its pre-\\npandemic level.26 \\n1.21 More recently labour market participation has become a major challenge to \\ngrowth. The UK economy has emerged from the pandemic with unemployment \\nnear a 50-year low; unemployment in the three months to January was 3.7%.27 \\nHowever, there are 490,000 more people of working age who are economically \\ninactive than prior to the pandemic (Box 3.A).  28 \\n1.22 A smaller labour force is leading to elevated vacancies and likely contributing \\nto higher inflation and weighing on growth. Firms report they are struggling to \\nhire workers.29 Although labour market data released in March suggested a slight \\nsoftening in demand and a reduction in inactivity, the labour market remains near \\nrecord levels of tightness.30 \\n1.23 The Chancellor’s growth strategy focuses on education, employment, \\nenterprise and everywhere. By prioritising these four areas the government can \\ndrive sustainable growth, which will support living standards and falling public \\ndebt. Central to this strategy are policies to increase business investment and boost \\nlabour supply. \\n1.24 The full expensing capital allowance announced in the Spring Budget aims \\nto incentivise firms to bring forward investment and thereby boost the level of \\nbusiness investment in the next few years. The government wants to ensure the tax \\nregime remains competitive longer term, and will make this measure permanent \\nas soon as it is economically responsible to do so. Additionally, an improving \\neconomic outlook and greater stability, which government support has helped \\nwith, will provide the right conditions to encourage businesses to invest. \\n1.25 The Spring Budget announces a number of measures to address inactivity in \\nthe labour market, centred around four cohorts: the long-term sick and disabled, \\nolder workers, welfare recipients and parents.

The OBR forecasts the economy \\nto contract in the first quarter of 2023 by 0.4% and not to grow in the second \\nquarter, before growth returns and strengthens over the rest of the forecast period. \\n1.27 GDP will fall by 0.2% on an annual basis over 2023 but has been revised up \\nby 1.2\\xa0percentage points compared to the OBR’s November forecast, the largest \\nupward revision the OBR has made to growth between forecasts outside the \\npandemic period.31 While cumulative GDP growth will be limited this year, the peak \\nto trough fall in output has been revised down significantly – from 2.1% to 0.6%. \\n1.28 Beyond this year, GDP growth increases, with the economy growing by 1.8% \\nand 2.5% in 2024 and 2025 respectively, as interest rates begin to fall and energy \\nprice falls take inflation below the 2% target. The OBR notes that the recovery is \\ndriven by private consumption, as real household incomes rise, and increased \\nbusiness investment, aided by changes to capital allowances. In 2026 and 2027, \\nGDP then grows by 2.1% and 1.9% respectively.\\n1.29 The unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly to a peak of 4.4%, 0.5 \\npercentage points below the OBR’s November forecast, and employment reaches \\n33.8 million by the end of the forecast, 850,000 higher than the pre-pandemic peak. \\nThe OBR judges that policies announced at the Spring Budget will have a material \\nimpact on labour supply, directly increasing employment by 0.3% and raising GDP \\nby 0.2% in 2027-28. This is the largest permanent increase in potential GDP the OBR \\nhas ever scored in their medium-term forecast as a result of government policy. \\n1.30 The outlook for business investment remains weak, but the OBR has judged \\nthat full expensing will help boost business investment by almost 3.5% in 2024-25 \\nand 2025-26. The OBR forecasts business investment to fall by 2.8% in 2023 but \\ngrow by 1.3% in 2024 and 6.1% in 2025. \\n1.31 The OBR’s forecast for potential output reflects their assessment of the \\nquantity of labour and capital available to businesses and the efficiency and \\nintensity with which these factors are deployed. Over the forecast period, potential \\noutput growth is expected to average 1.9% per year before settling at 1.75% in 2027-\\n28, unchanged from the November forecast. At the end of the forecast period, the \\nfinal level of potential output is 0.5% higher than in the OBR’s November forecast. \\n0.2 percentage points of this uplift is attributed by the OBR to policies announced \\nat the Spring Budget.\\n31 Historical official forecasts database , Office for Budget Responsibility, March 202320 Spring Budget 2023Debt\\nWhile the public finances have proved more resilient than \\nexpected in November, public debt remains high\\n1.32 Public sector net debt (PSND)32 currently stands at almost £2.5 trillion.33 The \\nOBR forecasts that PSND will reach 100.6% of GDP in 2022-23, which would be its \\nhighest level since the 1960s.34 Debt has risen over recent decades as a result of \\nexternal shocks like the Global Financial Crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and the \\nenergy crisis. These shocks have had material impacts on the economy and led to \\nhigher borrowing to fund additional support for households and businesses. The \\nimpact of these shocks has been felt globally, meaning that although debt as a \\nshare of GDP is historically high in the UK, it remains lower than the US, Canada, \\nFrance, Italy and Japan.35   \\n1.33 High inflation and rising interest rates have increased the cost of servicing \\ngovernment debt.

While this is £5.7 billion less than the OBR’s November forecast, \\nthis remains double the level seen last year. If debt interest spending were a \\ngovernment department, its departmental budget for 2022-23 would be second \\nonly to the Department for Health and Social Care (Table 2.1). The debt interest to \\nrevenue ratio reaches 10.1% this year which is the highest level since World War \\nTwo, demonstrating that debt interest spending represents a large burden relative \\nto the revenues that the government receives.37 This ratio falls over the forecast to \\n6.7% but remains elevated compared to the recent historical average (Chart 1.4). \\n1.35 Borrowing remains high in the context of recent history and when compared \\nto our international peers. While public sector net borrowing (PSNB) has fallen \\nfrom the post war peak in 2020-21, borrowing in 2021-22 remained nearly double \\nthe 2019-20 level.38 The UK is expected to have one of the highest levels of \\nborrowing, as a percentage of GDP, among major advanced economies in 2023.39   \\n37 HM Treasury Calculations using Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, March 2023.\\n38 Public sector finances , Office for National Statistics, January 2023.\\n39 HM Treasury calculations using OECD Economic Outlook , OECD, November 2022 and Economic and Fiscal \\nOutlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, March 2023. 23 Spring Budget 2023Debt falling over the medium term provides the stable \\nfoundations for economic growth\\n1.36 Sustainable public finances are necessary to provide the confidence and \\nstability to underpin economic growth. Keeping public debt on a sustainable path \\nis important because debt cannot continue to grow forever – at some point lenders \\nwould become concerned that they would not be repaid and choose to lend their \\nmoney elsewhere. Reducing debt will rebuild important buffers, providing space \\nfor the government to support households and businesses through future shocks \\nand help to reduce spending on debt interest that could otherwise be spent on \\npublic services. \\n1.37 The government’s plan to reduce debt as a proportion of GDP is particularly \\nimportant in the context of elevated risks. The OBR’s Fiscal Risks and Sustainability \\n(FRS) report noted the risks of high debt alongside heightened global challenges.40 \\nThe government’s response to the report, published alongside the Spring Budget, \\nhighlights rebuilding fiscal buffers is a key part of the government’s plan to \\nmanage and mitigate fiscal risks. The government’s approach to managing fiscal \\nrisks is at the forefront of international best practice.  \\n1.38 The government’s priority to reduce debt is aligned with the approach of other \\nadvanced economies around the world. Several countries have reaffirmed their \\ncommitments to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term, such as \\nCanada and France.41, 42\\nThe fiscal outlook has improved in recent months\\n1.39 At Autumn Statement 2022, the government took difficult, but necessary, \\ndecisions across taxation and spending to restore economic stability. Without these \\ndecisions, debt would have been on an unsustainable path.43 \\n1.40 The outlook for borrowing has improved relative to the OBR’s November \\nforecast. Borrowing in 2022-23 is £24.7 billion lower than the OBR forecast in \\nNovember, which reflects the strength in outturn data and is largely explained \\nby lower energy costs and stronger tax receipts. The OBR judges much of the \\nstrength in receipts will persist across the forecast period and a stronger economic \\nforecast is expected to boost receipts further. This improvement in the forecast \\nfor tax receipts, alongside lower debt interest costs due to lower expected interest \\nrates, have been the main 2022 factors driving the lower borrowing forecast \\nrelative to the Autumn Statement. After the policies announced at this event, the \\ngovernment is borrowing £19.9 billion less in 2027-28 compared to the November \\nforecast (Table 1.2). \\n40 Fiscal risks and sustainability , Office for Budget Responsibility, July 2022.\\n41 Draft Public Finance Programming Law for 2023-2027, France - Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Digital and \\nIndustrial Sovereignty, September 2022.\\n42 Fall economic statement 2022 , Department of Finance Canada, November 2022.\\xa0\\n43 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, November 2022. 24 Spring Budget 2023Debt is forecast to fall as a proportion of GDP by the end of the \\nforecast\\n1.41 Policies set out in the Spring Budget keep the public finances on a \\nsustainable path, with debt falling over the medium term.

The OBR notes these measures improve the strength \\nof the economy, which increases tax receipts, offsetting part of the direct cost. A \\nstronger economy also improves the affordability of the debt burden, as measured \\nby debt as a proportion of GDP.

By 2027-28, headline and underlying debt (public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England) levels are reduced by £53.7 billion (2.3% of \\nGDP) and £63 billion (2.6% of GDP), respectively (Chart 1.7). The OBR’s forecast \\n45 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, March 202326 Spring Budget 2023shows that underlying debt falls at the end of the forecast period, peaking in \\n2026-27, before falling to 94.6% of GDP in 2027-28, meeting the government’s \\nfiscal target. Despite the significant improvement in borrowing since Autumn \\nStatement 2022, the year in which debt is expected to fall is unchanged compared \\nto November (2027-28). This is because the path of debt is highly dependent on \\nthe profile of nominal GDP growth. Slower nominal GDP growth in the final year of \\nthe forecast, thanks to the shallower near-term economic downturn than expected \\nin November, leaves less space for above-trend growth in the medium term. The \\nOBR’s view of the medium-term potential growth rate has not changed, noting \\nthat real GDP will return towards the assumed medium-term growth rate by the \\nfinal year of the forecast.46 \\nChart 1.7: Public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England\\nSource: Ofﬁce for National Statistics and Ofﬁce for Budget Responsibility.\\n% of GDP\\nForecast\\n020406080100120\\n2027-282026-272025-262024-252023-242022-232021-222020-212019-202018-192017-182016-172015-162014-152013-142012-132011-122010-112009-102008-092007-082006-072005-062004-052003-042002-032001-022000-011999-001998-991997-98\\n1.45 The Net Financing Requirement for the Debt Management Office in 2023-\\n24 is forecast to be £246.1 billion; this will be financed by gilt sales of £241.1 billion \\nand net Treasury bill sales for debt management purposes of £5.0 billion. National \\nSavings and Investments will have a net financing target of £7.5 billion in 2023-24, \\nwithin a range of ± £3.0 billion. The government’s financing plans for 2023-24 are \\nsummarised in Annex A and set out in full in the ‘Debt Management Report 2023-\\n24’, published alongside the Spring Budget.   \\n46 Economic and fiscal outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, March 202327 Spring Budget 2023Debt is reduced in a sustainable way, supported by \\nresponsible management of the public sector balance sheet\\xa0\\n1.46 The Charter for Budget Responsibility includes an aim to strengthen over \\ntime a range of measures of the public sector balance sheet, as monitoring these \\nbroader metrics helps to ensure that debt is reduced in a sustainable way. Public \\nsector net worth (PSNW), the total value of the public sector’s assets and liabilities, \\nis expected to be on an improving path as a share of GDP from 2023-24 onwards. \\nThe OBR forecasts PSNW to strengthen from -81.6% of GDP in 2022-23 to -73.1% of \\nGDP in 2027-28, improving faster than underlying debt predominantly due to an \\nincrease in government-owned assets. Public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), \\na measure of the financial balance sheet, is forecast to fall from a peak of 89.3% of \\nGDP in 2023-24 to 85.7% in 2027-28. \\n1.47 When the government takes on risk, this can use up future fiscal space, so a \\nbalance sheet approach to fiscal sustainability includes transparency about new \\ncommitments that may result in future costs, known as contingent liabilities. \\nBetween October 2022 and March 2023, there were four new significant contingent \\nliabilities taken on, with £165 million of expected loss offset by £90 million of \\nexpected income. These include two Foreign, Commonwealth and Development \\nOffice guarantees facilities through the Just Energy Transition Partnership; an \\nindemnity provided by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero for the \\nEnergy Bills Support Scheme and Alternative Fuel Payment in Northern Ireland; \\nand an extension to HM Treasury’s Mortgage Guarantee Scheme. In addition, since \\nOctober 2022, the maximum exposure of the contingent liability associated with \\nthe Bank of England’s Asset Purchase Facility has fallen by £35 billion. This reflects the completion of the Bank’s temporary and targeted financial stability operation, \\nand the ongoing process of quantitative easing unwind. \\nTable 1.3: Newly approved contingent liabilities since Autumn Statement 2022\\nDepartmentNumber of \\nquantified \\ncontingent \\nliabilitiesReasonable worst \\ncase exposure (£m)Lifetime expected \\nloss (£m)Expected income \\n(£m)\\nHMT 1 2,500 75 90\\nDESNZ 1 30015 0\\nFCDO 2 2,200 85 0\\nTotals 4 5,005 165 90\\n1 This has been quantified as maximum exposure instead of reasonable worst case exposure.\\nSource: HM Treasury contingent liability database and Contingent Liability Central \\nCapability Analysis\\n1.48 Good balance sheet management includes realising the value of assets \\nthat previous policy interventions have added to the public sector’s holdings. The \\ngovernment remains committed to disposing of its shareholding in NatWest \\nGroup, acquired as a result of the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis, subject \\nto market conditions and achieving value for money for taxpayers. Having 28 Spring Budget 2023successfully reduced its shareholding to under 42%47 the government intends for \\nits programme of sales to conclude by 2025-26. The government will seek to\\xa0ensure \\nthat the NatWest trading plan, which has made a critical contribution with \\nover £3.5bn of sales as of 1 March 2023, continues to support sales while actively \\nseeking to utilise other disposal options when market conditions permit, including \\naccelerated bookbuilds and directed buybacks. \\nPerformance against our fiscal rules\\n1.49 The OBR confirms the government is on track to meet both its borrowing and \\ndebt fiscal rules. In the target year (2027-28), underlying debt falls to 94.6% of GDP. \\nThe borrowing rule is met two years early, at 2.8% of GDP in 2025-26 and 2.2% in \\n2026-27 before falling to 1.7% in the final year. \\n1.50 The OBR has forecast that the welfare cap will be breached by £4.1 billion \\nin 2024-25. The increase in welfare spending is largely due to higher demand for \\ndisability benefits, and health related claims to Universal Credit. Nonetheless, the \\ngovernment remains committed to ensuring welfare spending is sustainable and is \\nfocused on meeting the welfare cap by the formal assessment year of 2024-25.\\n1.51 In accordance with the Charter for Budget Responsibility, the level of the \\nwelfare cap and pathway has been adjusted to reflect a fiscally neutral classification \\nchange associated with changes to the Administrative Earnings Threshold on \\nUniversal Credit.\\n1.52 The debt and borrowing fiscal rules are met with a margin of safety \\n(“headroom”) of £6.5 billion against the debt rule and £39.2 billion against the \\nborrowing rule in the target year. As set out above, the material improvement in \\nborrowing headroom has not carried through in full to the debt rule, meaning \\ndebt falling remains a constraint on any permanent fiscal loosening. Headroom \\nsupports stability by reducing the risk the government needs to adjust policy if \\nthe forecast deteriorates, but the level needs to balance implications for public \\nservices, taxes and the economy. The OBR notes the outlook is ‘somewhat brighter’ \\ncompared to November, but also that headroom to debt falling is low by historical \\nstandards and would be eliminated by just a 0.2 percentage point change in \\nnominal growth in 2027-28. \\n47 As of 1 March 202329 Spring Budget 2023Forecast Summary\\nTable 1.4: Overview of the OBR’s economic forecast\\nOutturn Forecast\\n2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027\\nGDP growth 7.6 4.0 -0.2 1.8 2.5 2.1 1.9\\nGDP growth per capita 7.2 3.4 -0.8 1.3 2.0 1.7 1.5\\nPotential output growth 2.5 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.8\\nMain components of GDP\\nHousehold consumption26.2 5.4 -0.8 1.5 1.8 1.7 1.9\\nGeneral government consumption 12.5 1.9 3.7 1.6 1.2 1.5 1.9\\nTotal Fixed investment 6.1 7.7 -1.6 0.7 3.5 2.1 -0.4\\nBusiness investment 0.9 9.9 -2.8 1.3 6.1 1.9 -1.9\\nGeneral government investment 5.3 2.8 12.3 0.4 -3.3 -1.1 -1.4\\nPrivate dwellings investment316.9 6.6 -7.4 -0.1 3.4 4.6 2.9\\nChange in inventories41.0 0.0 -0.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\\nExports 2.2 10.3 -6.6 -0.3 1.1 0.7 0.4\\nImports 6.2 12.6 -4.0 -1.3 -0.4 -0.5 -0.9\\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) inflation 2.6 9.1 6.1 0.9 0.1 0.5 1.6\\nEmployment (millions) 32.4 32.7 32.8 32.8 33.1 33.4 33.7\\nUnemployment (% rate) 4.5 3.7 4.1 4.4 4.3 4.2 4.1\\nProductivity – output per hour 1.0 0.4 0.1 1.0 1.3 1.2 1.1\\n1 All figures in this table are rounded to the nearest decimal place.

This includes taking \\naction to support households and businesses with the impacts of high inflation \\nand the increased cost of living and continuing to support vital public services. \\nSustainable public finances\\n2.2 Autumn Statement 2022 set out a fiscally responsible path to getting debt \\nfalling as a share of the economy, protecting vital public services, and prioritising \\nthe needs of the most vulnerable. Through Spring Budget 2023 the government \\ncontinues to take responsible decisions on public spending, helping to limit \\ninflationary pressure and get debt falling. This includes prioritising spending to help \\nmore people into employment and enhance the country’s defence in the context \\nof Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine.\\nPublic spending\\n2.3 Spending Review 2021 set UK government departments’ resource and capital \\nDepartmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) budgets and the devolved administrations’ \\nblock grants from 2022-23 to 2024-25.\\n2.4 Since those budgets were set, Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and global \\nsupply chain pressures pushed inflation to 40-year highs.48 While inflation has \\npeaked, the economic environment remains challenging. The government is \\ntherefore working more efficiently within this context to ensure government \\ndepartments can continue to operate within their budgets while still delivering the \\noutcomes that matter most for the public and driving value for every taxpayer.\\n2.5 At Autumn Statement 2022, the government made available up to an \\nadditional £6.1 billion in 2023-24 and £8 billion in 2024-25 to support health and \\nadult social care services, and an additional £2.3 billion in each of 2023-24 and \\n2024 -25 for the core schools budget in England.\\n2.6 The Spring Budget includes an additional £3.1 billion a year by 2024-25 \\nrising to £5.2 billion at the end of the forecast period to help get more people \\ninto employment.49\\n48  Consumer price inflation time series , Office for National Statistics, February 2023.\\n49  These figures are DEL. 32 Spring Budget 20232.7 The government is also providing an extra £5 billion for defence and national \\nsecurity priorities over the next 2 years and £2 billion each year for defence for \\nthe remainder of the forecast period. This is in recognition of the deteriorating \\nsecurity environment where the UK must be able to deter and defend against \\nincreasing threats to our security, as described in the Integrated Review Refresh. \\nThis will improve the resilience and readiness of the country’s forces, by bolstering \\nour conventional stockpiles, enabling early investment for the AUKUS submarine \\nalliance, and modernising our nuclear enterprise. As set out in the Integrated \\nReview Refresh, the government’s aspiration over the longer term is to invest 2.5% \\nof GDP in defence, as the fiscal and economic circumstances allow.\\n2.8 To ensure the whole of government is geared up to deliver for the British \\npeople, the government created four new departments in February: the \\nDepartment for Energy Security and Net Zero, the Department for Science, \\nInnovation and Technology, the Department for Business and Trade, and the \\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport.

The Scottish Government is receiving £320 million, the Welsh \\nGovernment £180 million and the Northern Ireland Executive £130 million. This is \\non top of record Spending Review 2021 settlements, which are still growing in real \\nterms over the Spending Review period, and an additional £3.4 billion at Autumn \\nStatement 2022.\\nWorking more efficiently\\n2.14 To keep spending focused on the government’s priorities, the government \\nis committed to continuing to identify ways to work more efficiently and reduce \\nday-to-day running costs of government. The government therefore launched an \\nEfficiency and Savings Review as part of Autumn Statement 2022.\\n2.15 Through the review, departments have reprioritised and identified further \\nefficiencies, building on the 5% efficiency challenge set at Spending Review \\n2021. This means that the government can protect the vital frontline services \\nthat matter most to the public despite the impacts of higher inflation. This \\nincludes the efficiency savings the NHS is making to achieve their efficiency \\ntarget of 2.2% and the efficiency savings agreed with the Ministry of Defence at \\nSpending Review 2020.39 Spring Budget 20232.16 The government is accelerating plans to innovate and automate public service \\ndelivery and is embracing evaluation to make sure spending is focused on what \\nworks. This includes incentivising further testing and evaluation of innovative \\napproaches to cross-government working by providing a further £30.4 million \\nfrom the Shared Outcomes Fund to 10 existing projects covering areas such \\nas data and digital, education, and service provision for people experiencing \\nmultiple disadvantages.\\n2.17 To track efficiency and drive continuous improvement, the government is \\ndeveloping a new Government Efficiency Framework to improve how departments \\nreport efficiency savings and ensure government has the appropriate oversight \\nand reporting processes for efficiency savings.\\n2.18 The government is committed to ensuring public services are funded \\nfairly by maintaining a low tax gap. The government will double the maximum \\nsentences for the most egregious cases of tax fraud from 7 to 14 years, and will \\nconsult shortly on the introduction of a new criminal offence for promoters of tax \\navoidance who fail to comply with a legal notice from HMRC to stop promoting a \\ntax avoidance scheme. The government is also investing a further £47.2 million to \\nimprove HMRC’s capability to collect tax debts, including supporting those who are \\ntemporarily unable to pay.\\nHelping with the cost of living\\n2.19 Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and weaponisation of gas supplies to Europe, \\nas well as global supply chain pressures, have contributed to global high inflation.51 \\nThe government is committed to supporting households and businesses with the \\nrising cost of living.\\n2.20  At Autumn Statement 2022, the government announced benefits uprating \\nand generous cost of living support for 2023-24. This included additional Cost of \\nLiving Payments for more than 8 million households on means-tested benefits, \\n6 million people on disability benefits, and 8 million pensioner households \\nacross the UK. It also included an additional £1 billion to enable the extension \\nof the Household Support Fund in England, to help households with the \\ncost of essentials.\\n2.21 At the Spring Budget, the government is taking further steps, including \\nadditional energy support, childcare support, and extending the cut to fuel duty.\\n2.22 The government has already taken decisive action to support households \\nthrough the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG), which places a limit on the price \\nhouseholds pay per unit of gas and electricity. In the face of retail energy costs that \\nare expected to remain historically high through the spring, the government is \\nmaintaining the EPG at its current £2,500 per year level for an additional 3 months \\n(April to June 2023). The planned increase to a level of £3,000 per year will therefore \\nbe implemented on 1 July, rather than 1 April as previously announced.\\n51 Consumer price indices , OECD, 2023.40 Spring Budget 20232.23 The government is also providing domestic UK Heat Network customers on \\nnon-domestic heating contracts with a new, sector specific support rate. This will \\nbe set at a level that will ensure these customers do not face disproportionately \\nhigher energy bills under the Energy Bills Discount Scheme than consumers \\nunder the EPG. \\n2.24  The government continues to develop options to support domestic \\nconsumers on a non-domestic meter where they are facing lower levels of support \\nthan other domestic consumers. The Department for Energy Security and Net \\nZero will issue a call for evidence before the summer for domestic consumers who \\nreceive their energy via a non-domestic energy contract.\\n2.25 The government is also removing the premium paid by over 4 million \\nhouseholds using prepayment meters (PPM),52 bringing their charges into line \\nwith comparable direct debit customers until the EPG ends and saving them \\nan average of £45 a year. PPM consumers are disproportionately vulnerable, \\non lower incomes and in fuel poverty, and therefore are more exposed to price \\nchanges. Looking beyond the end of the EPG, the government will ensure \\nthe PPM premium is ended on a permanent basis. The government supports \\nOfgem’s ongoing work to review PPM costs and has asked the regulator to \\nreport by the autumn on any additional regulatory options, including options \\nfor ending the PPM standing charge premium, so that they are ready for \\nimplementation in April 2024.\\n2.26 Petrol and diesel prices continue to be volatile given the ongoing conflict \\nin Ukraine and inflation remains high. The government is continuing to support \\nhouseholds and businesses by maintaining the rates of fuel duty at the current \\nlevels for an additional 12 months through extending the temporary 5p fuel duty \\ncut and cancelling the planned increase in line with inflation for 2023-24. This \\nsupport is already available for longer than in many countries and represents \\n£10 billion of support over 2 years, worth around £200 for the average car driver. \\nThe government will continue to keep fuel duty rates in the long term under \\nreview, including carefully considering support for motorists, fiscal implications \\nand use of fuels.\\n2.27 The government is increasing the amount of income tax relief available to \\nfoster carers and shared lives carers. The threshold of income at which qualifying \\ncarers begin paying tax on care income will be increased to £18,140 per year plus \\n£375 to £450 per person cared for per week for 2023-24 and these thresholds \\nwill then be index-linked, representing a tax cut worth approximately £450 per \\nyear on average.\\n52  This figure comprises UREGNI data on Northern Ireland PPM consumers (available at https://www.uregni.gov.\\nuk/publications/q4-2022-qremm , p.11), and a GOV.UK QEP dataset on GB customer numbers ( https://www.gov.uk/\\ngovernment/statistical-data-sets/quarterly-domestic-energy-switching-statistics ), applying splits from existing \\nGOV.UK EBSS customer data sets ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/\\nattachment_data/file/1126050/table_252.xlsx ).41 Spring Budget 20232.28 Community facilities have also been impacted by the cost of living. The \\ngovernment is therefore providing over £100 million to support charities and \\ncommunity organisations and over £60 million to support public swimming \\npools in England, to help with immediate pressures and invest in energy \\nefficiency measures.\\nSupporting the NHS\\n2.29 The government is investing record levels of funding in response to the \\npressures facing our vital health and social care services. Autumn Statement \\n2022 made available up to £8 billion of additional funding for the NHS and adult \\nsocial care in England in 2024-25, with an additional £3.3 billion in each of 2023-24 \\nand 2024-25 to support the NHS in England and up to £2.8 billion in 2023-24 and \\n£4.7 billion in 2024-25 to support adult social care and discharge.\\n2.30 This investment is enabling rapid action to improve urgent and emergency \\ncare, as set out in the recent recovery plan, and primary care, with further details \\nto be published shortly.53 This is in addition to planned spending of more than \\n£8 billion across 2022-23 to 2024-25, as confirmed at Spending Review 2021, to \\ntackle the elective backlog. Last year, the NHS hit its target to virtually eliminate \\nwaits of over 2 years and is making progress towards the ambition of tackling \\n18-month waits by April 2023.\\n2.31 The NHS is the UK’s biggest employer, and the government is committed \\nto ensuring it has the workforce it needs for the future.54 This includes shortly \\npublishing the long-term workforce plan committed to at Autumn Statement \\n2022 and the pension tax reforms announced in the Spring Budget which will \\nhelp remove incentives for doctors to work reduced hours or retire early due to \\npension tax concerns.\\n53 Delivery plan for recovering urgent and emergency care services,  NHS England, January 2023.\\n54 NHS Long Term Plan , NHS, January 2019.

Growing the economy is one of the Prime Minister’s five key \\npriorities and is the focus of Spring Budget 2023. The government is committed to \\nattracting investment to achieve a high wage high skill economy.\\n3.2 Boosting economic growth is the only way to sustainably raise living standards \\nand fund the high quality public services the UK population needs. \\n3.3 There are many underlying strengths of the UK’s economy, which will underpin \\nfuture growth. The UK has a dynamic business environment and was ranked by \\nthe World Bank in 2020 as the best place to do business amongst large European \\nnations and second only to the US in the G7.55 The UK economy is also highly \\ninnovative, ranked fourth in the Global Innovation Index, and home to three of \\nthe world’s top ten universities.56 Its digital, life sciences and creative sectors are \\namongst the largest in the world.57 The UK is on track to become a world leading \\nscience superpower, supported by the newly established Department for Science, \\nInnovation and Technology. \\n3.4 However, UK productivity was 17% weaker in 2021 than the average across \\nFrance, Germany and the US.58 Weakness in business investment accounts for part \\nof this gap. UK business investment accounted for 10% of GDP in 2021 compared to \\n12% on average across Germany, France and the US.59 There are also longstanding \\ngaps in provision of certain skills. The share of adults with vocational qualifications, \\nfor example, is 9 percentage points below the OECD average.60 \\n3.5 The government has a plan to address these challenges and build on the UK’s \\nareas of strength. The Spring Budget prioritises:\\n• Employment:  boosting labour supply, including by encouraging the \\ninactive into work\\n• Education:  providing everyone with the skills and support they need\\n• Enterprise: providing the right conditions for businesses to succeed\\n55 Doing Business  report 2020, World Bank Group.\\n56 Global Innovation Index,  2022; The Times World University Rankings,  2023.\\n57 UK tech industry position , 2022; UK life sciences industry position , 2019; UK creative sectors strength , 2020.\\n58 Data taken from OECD GDP per capita and productivity levels | OECD Productivity Statistics | OECD iLibrary \\n(oecd-ilibrary.org) .

Being in \\nmeaningful work enables people to realise social, health and financial benefits. \\nSpring Budget delivers an ambitious package to increase labour supply and ensure \\nthe UK continues to attract global talent. \\n3.7 The government believes that people should be able to access the Education  \\nand training they need to get the jobs they want. A good education system is the \\nbest economic and social policy any country can have, and education should not \\nstop when you start work. UK employers spend just half the European average on \\nvocational training for their employees, and less than 10% of total spend on training \\ngoes towards formal high quality training delivered by external institutions.61 Skills \\nBootcamps and the Lifelong Loan Entitlement are already in place.\\n3.8 The government is creating the right conditions for Enterprise  in all sectors \\nacross the economy, based on competitive taxes, access to capital and smarter \\nregulation. By supporting entrepreneurs and attracting the most productive \\ncompanies to set up, invest and grow in the UK, stronger growth can be delivered \\nin future industries. Spring Budget delivers a range of enterprise boosting \\nmeasures, such as tax incentives and smarter regulation, that taken together will \\nsupport future growth for the long-term.\\n3.9 The government is committed to spreading the benefits of economic growth \\nEverywhere . The UK’s spatial disparities in productivity are large compared to other \\nadvanced economies; there is significant untapped growth potential in the UK’s \\ncities outside London, and despite recent progress on devolution the UK’s decision \\nmaking remains overly centralised.62 Empowered, accountable local leaders are \\nbest placed to take the decisions needed to foster local wealth creation and civic \\nentrepreneurialism. Spring Budget drives this vision forward, delivering change \\nfor all parts of the UK, including through the creation of Investment Zones and \\nempowering local leadership through further devolution. \\n3.10 The government is taking bold steps to improve growth and raise economic \\nprospects for everyone. Taken together, these announcements make a significant \\ncontribution to delivering on the government’s plan for the UK economy to grow \\nsustainably for years to come, with the benefits of that growth spread across every \\npart of the country. \\n61 Eurostat, Continuing Vocational Training , 2015 ( public data available in this report ); Department for Education’s  \\nEmployer Skills Survey , 2019.\\n62 Levelling Up the United Kingdom , HM Government, 2 February 2022; ‘Centralisation Nation’ , Centre for Cities,  \\n2 September 2022.45 Spring Budget 2023Helping people into Employment\\n3.11 Increasing the number of people in the labour market is important for \\ngrowing the UK economy, bringing down debt and inflation, and improving \\nliving standards.\\n3.12 The UK economy has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic with \\nunemployment near a 50-year low, following a rapid rise in employment across the \\n2010s. However, since the pandemic, the UK has seen a significant increase in the \\nnumber of people of working age neither in work nor looking for work. Of the UK’s \\nworking age population, 6.7 million are economically inactive excluding students. \\nThe UK’s inactivity rate is 21.3%, 1.1 percentage points higher than the pre-pandemic \\nlow of 20.2%.63 \\n3.13 This rise in economic inactivity, combined with low unemployment, has \\ncontributed to labour shortages and increased job vacancies, holding back the UK’s \\neconomic prospects. To help address this challenge, the government is introducing \\npolicies to help more people enter work, increase their working hours, and extend \\ntheir working lives. \\n3.14 At Autumn Statement 2022, the Chancellor announced that the Department \\nfor Work and Pensions (DWP) would thoroughly review workforce participation. \\nReflecting on this work, the government’s employment strategy will focus support \\ntowards those groups where inactivity levels are high  or where employment \\nsupport is most needed, including the long-term sick and disabled, welfare \\nrecipients, people aged over 50, and parents.64 The government wants to work in \\npartnership with employers to support people to find and progress in work.\\n63  A02 NSA: Employment, unemployment and economic inactivity for people aged 16 and over and aged from 16 \\nto 64 (not seasonally adjusted) - Office for National Statistics ( ons.gov.uk ) - 14 March 2023 release.\\n64  A05 SA: Employment, unemployment and economic inactivity by age group (seasonally adjusted) - Office for \\nNational Statistics (ons.gov.uk); INAC01 SA: Economic inactivity by reason (seasonally adjusted) - Office for National \\nStatistics (ons.gov.uk); Economic activity and employment type for men and women by age of the youngest \\ndependent child living with them in the UK: Table S - Office for National Statistics (ons.gov.uk).46 Spring Budget 2023Box 3.A Unemployment remains low: however, falling \\nparticipation is a key economic challenge \\nDespite historically low unemployment, there remain 230,000 fewer people \\nin employment than at the start of the pandemic.65 This is driven by a large \\nand sustained rise in labour market inactivity, which for those of working-\\nage has increased by 490,000.66, 67 There are a number of possible factors \\nunderlying this increase.\\nAcross age groups, the increase in inactivity has also been concentrated among \\nolder workers, with the inactivity rate amongst 50 to 64 year-olds having \\nincreased by 2 percentage points since the start of the pandemic. By reason, \\nthere are 410,000 more people reporting they are inactive due to long-term \\nsickness since the start of the pandemic.68 This increase has occurred across all \\nworking age groups.69 For those who have left work recently, there has been an \\nincrease in the number reporting retirement as the main reason.70 The ONS’s \\nOver 50s Lifestyle Study suggested that those above 60 were most likely to cite ‘to \\nretire from paid work’ as a reason for leaving work, while those aged 50 to 54 were \\nmore likely to cite ‘stress’ and that ‘I did not feel supported in my job’.\\nThe UK inactivity rate is currently significantly higher than in the best performing \\nOECD comparators. This suggests there is considerable scope to reduce \\nit, boosting labour supply and growing the economy. While inactivity is 5.2 \\npercentage points lower than the OECD average, the UK has fallen from having \\nthe 8th lowest inactivity to 15th in the OECD since the pandemic (see Chart 3.3).71 \\nReducing UK inactivity to the same rate as the Netherlands, the second best \\nperformer in the OECD, would result in 2.7 million more people in the labour \\nforce, an increase of over 8%.72\\n65 A01 SA: Summary of labour market statistics – ONS (ons.gov.uk), 14 March Release.\\n66 A person is economically inactive if they are not in employment and have not been seeking work within the last \\n4 weeks and/or are unable to start work within the next 2 weeks.\\n67 A01 SA: Summary of labour market statistics – ONS (ons.gov.uk) – 14 March Release.\\n68 A01 SA: Summary of labour market statistics – ONS (ons.gov.uk) – 14 March Release.\\n69 HMT calculations using Labour Force Survey microdata.\\n70 HMT calculations using Labour Force Survey longitudinal two-quarter microdata.\\n71 OECD, Short-Term Labour Market Statistics (oecd.org) .

This represents a step \\nchange in the government’s ambition on digital resources for mental health and \\nMSK, putting the NHS at the forefront in its use of innovative technologies. \\n3.18 The government will also pilot a new programme, WorkWell, to better \\nintegrate employment and health support for those with health conditions, \\nsupporting individuals into employment and to remain in work.\\n3.19 To support those claiming benefits who are long-term sick and disabled, \\nthe government is publishing a Health and Disability White Paper. This sets out \\nambitious and extensive reforms to make sure those with disabilities have the \\nright support, opportunities, and incentives to move into and remain in work. The \\nWork Capability Assessment will be abolished and eligibility for the health top-up \\nin Universal Credit will be passported via the Personal Independence Payment \\nbenefit. Claimants will benefit from tailored Work Coach support and be able to try \\nwork without fear of losing their benefits.\\n3.20 The government will also increase the funding available in Great Britain \\nfor Work Coaches to help those who are long-term sick and disabled into work. \\nIncreased Work Coach support, alongside the other measures to improve \\ndisability employment being announced at the Spring Budget, will be key to \\nproviding tailored support for people whose disability or health condition presents \\nbarriers to work. \\n3.21 The government will introduce a new programme to support people with \\ndisabilities and long-term sickness into work. A new Universal Support programme \\nwill match individuals in England and Wales who want to work with existing job \\nvacancies, and ensure they are supported to enter and stay in work by funding the \\nnecessary training and workplace support. \\n86  Summary: The work aspirations and support needs of claimants in the ESA Support Group and Universal Credit \\nequivalent - GOV.UK ( www.gov.uk ).50 Spring Budget 2023Welfare recipients\\n3.22 Securing more and better paid work raises living standards and improves lives. \\nThere are currently 5.9 million Universal Credit claimants in Great Britain.87 Many \\nof these people are out of work or on low earnings and could be earning higher \\nwages and contributing more to the economy. \\n3.23 The longer an individual remains out of the labour market or on low earnings, \\nthe harder it is for them to move back into work and progress in the workplace.88 \\nEvidence suggests that the support that people can access through Universal \\nCredit, including time with Work Coaches and tailored job support, can help \\nimprove labour market outcomes.89 That is why the government is announcing an \\nambitious package of welfare measures to incentivise work and provide even more \\njob support for Universal Credit claimants.\\n3.24 The government will increase Work Coach support and work search \\nrequirements for a greater number of Universal Credit claimants to help them \\nmove into work and onto high earnings. This includes increasing the Administrative \\nEarnings Threshold, which determines how much support and Work Coach \\ntime a claimant will receive based on their earnings, for an individual claimant, \\nand removing the couple’s Administrative Earnings Threshold. This will provide \\nintensive Work Coach support to claimants in work and on lower earnings and \\nnon-working or low-earning partners on Universal Credit. The government will also \\nstrengthen job support for claimants that are lead carers of young children who \\ncurrently have no or limited requirements to search for and prepare for work. \\n3.25 Alongside this, the government is strengthening the way the sanctions \\nregime is applied, by automating parts of the process to improve efficiency and \\nreduce error, and ensuring that Work Coaches have the tools and training to \\nimplement sanctions as effectively as possible, including for failing to take up a job.\\n3.26 The government will extend the Youth Offer, which provides targeted support \\nto unemployed young people on Universal Credit. This means that young people \\nacross Great Britain will have continued access to partner-led Youth Hubs and \\nspecialist Youth Employability Coaches to break down barriers to work. Eligibility for \\nthe Youth Offer will also be expanded to include young people on Universal Credit \\nwho are not currently searching for work, including young parents and carers. \\n3.27 To help young people leaving residential care into employment, the \\ngovernment is providing an additional £8.1 million in each of the next 2 years \\nto expand the Staying Close programme to around half of local authorities by \\nMarch 2025. Staying Close provides young people leaving residential care with \\naccommodation, and practical and emotional support, as they transition into \\nindependent adulthood. \\n87   Department for Work and Pensions benefit statistics - Stat-Xplore\\xa0-\\xa0Table View (dwp.gov.uk) . \\n88  Office for National Statistics 2021 - Which groups find it hardest to find a job following a period out of work? ; \\nArulampalam, W., Gregg, P., & Gregory, M.

The pilot will test how intensive support for a period of 2 weeks can \\nfurther support claimants, who remain unemployed after 13 and 26 weeks into \\ntheir Universal Credit claim or on low earnings, into work. As part of this pilot, the \\ngovernment will also trial a scheme that rewards Jobcentre teams for meeting \\nstretching targets for helping claimants into work. \\nExtending working lives\\n3.29 The number of inactive 50 to 64 year-olds has increased by 320,000 since \\nbefore the pandemic, with this age group accounting for 65% of the increase in \\nworking-age inactivity over this period.90 Inactivity among older workers is higher \\nthan that of the best performing economies in the OECD (see Box 3.A).91 The UK \\nhas an ageing population, so increasing labour market participation for this group \\nto bring it in line with rates seen in international comparators would grow the \\neconomy, while increasing the overall experience of the UK’s labour force. \\n3.30 The government believes that workers of all ages have a vital role to play in \\ntheir place of work and the wider economy. Through the policies set out in the \\nSpring Budget, the government wants to encourage inactive individuals aged \\nover\\xa050 to stay in and return to work. \\n3.31 Planning for later life can be difficult, and some may leave the workforce early \\nwithout a full understanding of their long-term financial resilience.\\xa0 A midlife MOT \\nis a review to help individuals take stock of their finances and wellbeing to prepare \\nfor a more secure retirement. The government will enhance the digital strand of \\nthe offer to ensure more people can access targeted online guidance regarding \\ntheir career, health and finances. DWP will also expand access to its in-person \\nmidlife MOT offer, providing financial planning and awareness sessions for 50+ \\nUniversal Credit claimants, aiming to reach up to 40,000 individuals a year. \\n3.32 As part of this, the government is bringing forward policies that incentivise \\nhighly skilled individuals to remain in the labour market. Currently, there are limits \\nplaced on the total tax-relieved pension savings an individual can make each year \\nand over their lifetime. To stop these limits from acting as a barrier to remaining \\nin work, the government will remove the Lifetime Allowance charge, before \\ncompletely abolishing it in a future Finance Bill, and raise the Annual Allowance to \\n£60,000 from April 2023.\\n3.33 Once an individual flexibly accesses their defined contribution pension \\nsavings, the total tax-relieved pension savings they can make each year is restricted \\nto the level of the Money Purchase Annual Allowance.

The \\ngovernment wants to partner with employers to help people manage transitions \\nand overcome barriers to work, so that they can continue to progress and thrive in \\nthe workplace. \\n3.36 Employer-led occupational health services can reduce health-related inactivity \\nby identifying, monitoring and preventing health problems in the workplace, \\nsupporting employees to remain healthy and happy in work. Around half of UK \\nemployees currently have access to occupational health services, which is lower \\nthan some international comparators.92, 93\\n3.37 To support more businesses to provide occupational health services, the \\ngovernment will expand the forthcoming occupational health pilot subsidy \\nscheme for small and medium sized businesses announced by the Department \\nfor Health and Social Care and DWP in 2021. The government will also launch a \\nseparate consultation on options for incentivising greater take-up of occupational \\nhealth provision through the tax system.\\n3.38 The government will consult on ways to boost UK occupational health \\ncoverage, including, for example, through regulations to require employers to \\nprovide occupational health services. The consultation will also consider a process \\nof kitemarking and professional accreditation to assure quality of occupational \\nhealth services. To ensure occupational health providers can meet this increased \\ndemand for their services, the consultation will also consider the supply of \\noccupational health professionals, including through the Long-Term Workforce \\nPlan for the NHS.\\n3.39 Working flexibly can help employees balance work commitments and \\npersonal circumstances, such as parenting, caring, managing a health condition, \\nor transitioning from full-time work later in life. The government is reforming the \\nstatutory framework for flexible working to provide employees with a day one right \\nto request their job be done flexibly. The government will work with employers to \\ndemonstrate the benefits of offering flexible working, including through initiatives \\n92  Government response: Health is everyone’s business (2021) .\\n93  France, Germany and Finland all have occupational health coverage over 90%.

Often, the \\nflexible working arrangements people need to manage their lives are ad hoc and \\ninformal. To understand more about how these less-formalised types of flexibility \\nwork in practice, the government will launch a call for evidence in summer 2023. \\n3.40 To further support employees with caring or parenting responsibilities to \\nremain in the labour market, the government is backing Private Member Bills \\nthat provide unpaid carers with additional leave, parents with greater protections \\nagainst redundancy, and parents of children receiving neo-natal care with paid \\nstatutory leave. \\nMigration\\n3.41 Alongside investments to support people into work, the government will \\nensure that the UK labour market has access to skills and talent from abroad where \\nneeded, to help businesses tackle immediate labour shortages and ease business \\nvisits to the UK. \\n3.42 To help ease immediate labour supply pressures, the government \\ncommissioned the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to undertake a rapid \\nShortage Occupation List (SOL) assessment for the construction and hospitality \\nsectors, ahead of its full review of the SOL concluding later in 2023. The government \\nhas accepted the MAC’s interim recommendations, to initially add five construction \\noccupations to the SOL, which will take effect before summer recess. The \\ngovernment will also review the SOL more regularly, based on recommendations \\nfrom the MAC, so that the legal migration system is quicker and more responsive \\nto the needs of businesses and the economy. \\n3.43 To make it easier and more attractive to do business in the UK, the \\ngovernment will simplify business visitor rules. This includes expanding the \\nrange of short-term business activities that can be carried out for periods of up \\nto 6 months and reviewing permitted paid engagements. These changes will be \\nimplemented from autumn 2023. In addition, the government will consider further \\nenhanced provisions linked to negotiations with trade partners, including a wider \\nrange of activities. \\nParents\\n3.44 The employment rate and hours worked of parents, particularly mothers, \\ndrops after childbirth and persists until after their children reach school age.94 \\nThere are around 435,000 parents in England with children under 3 years who are \\ninactive due to caring responsibilities.95 \\n94  IFS (2021) Women much more likely than men to give up paid work or cut hours after childbirth even when they \\nearn more .\\n95  ONS (2023): Economic activity and employment type for men and women by age of youngest dependent child \\nliving with them in the UK: Table S .54 Spring Budget 20233.45 This group is made up disproportionately of women, and the more time \\nthey spend outside the labour market or working part-time, the lower their future \\nexpected earnings, worsening the UK’s gender pay gap.96, The UK’s female inactivity \\nrate is higher than in the best performing OECD economies (see Box 3.A).97 \\n3.46 The government is removing one of the biggest barriers to parents working, \\nby substantially increasing the amount of free childcare that working families can \\naccess. The government will provide over £4.1 billion by 2027-28 to fund 30 free \\nhours per week for working parents with children aged 9 months up to 3 years in \\nEngland, where eligibility will match the existing 3 to 4 year-old 30 hours offer.  \\n3.47 This will close the gap between the end of parental leave and the start of the \\ncurrent free childcare hours offer, and will mean that parents will be empowered to \\nwork sooner to support their families and progress their careers. This new offer will \\nmean that the government is supporting parents who choose to return to work, \\nfrom when their child is 9 months old until they leave school. \\n3.48 From April 2024, working parents of 2 year-olds will be able to access 15 hours \\nof free childcare per week, benefiting parents of up to 285,000 children.98 This will \\nbe extended to working parents of 9 month to 2 year-olds from September 2024, \\nbenefiting parents of up to 640,000 children.99 From September 2025, all eligible \\nworking parents of children aged 9 months up to 3 years will be able to access \\n30\\xa0free hours per week. \\n3.49  The government is also substantially uplifting the hourly funding rate paid \\nto providers, to deliver the existing free hours offers in England. This will help \\nproviders to manage cost pressures, and develop the necessary capacity to \\ndeliver the new free hours offers, as well as raising the quality of provision. The \\ngovernment will provide £204 million in 2023-24, paid from September 2023, and \\n£288 million in 2024-25.\\n3.50 To increase flexibility for providers and the availability of childcare provision \\nfor parents, the government will proceed with changing staff-to-child ratios from \\n1:4 to 1:5 for 2 year-olds in England, to align with Scotland and other countries. \\nThis change will come into force from September 2023, subject to parliamentary \\nprocedure.  The government will also increase choice and affordability for parents, \\nby taking action to increase the number of childminders.

This will \\ninclude exploring further flexibilities for providers; allowing childminders more \\nchoice over how they operate, and introducing a new, streamlined childminder-\\nspecific Early Years Foundation Stage framework. \\n3.52 Many parents work fewer hours even when their children reach school-\\nage.  A key driver of this is accessibility of childcare provision, with only 64% of \\nprimary schools currently offering childcare at both ends of the school day.100 To \\nhelp ensure that working parents are not forced to reduce their hours due to \\ncaring responsibilities, the government is launching a new wraparound childcare \\npathfinder scheme and setting out the ambition that all parents of primary-aged \\nchildren in England can access care in school from 8am-6pm. The government will \\nprovide £289 million in start-up funding to enable schools and local authorities to \\ntest options to increase the availability of wraparound childcare in the longer term, \\nwith national roll out over academic years 2024-25 and 2025-26. \\n3.53 There are around 2.2 million households with children on Universal Credit.101 \\nCurrently, only around 13% of households eligible for the childcare element in \\nUniversal Credit claim it.102 The current offer means parents on Universal Credit in \\nwork can claim back 85% of their childcare costs and this is paid in monthly arrears. \\nThis presents an issue for many low-income families who struggle to find the funds \\nto pay for their childcare upfront. \\n3.54 To help address this issue for parents on Universal Credit in Great Britain who \\nare moving into work or increasing their hours, the government will make sure they \\nhave support with childcare costs upfront when they need it rather than in arrears. \\nThis will help remove a barrier that many low-income parents face on Universal \\nCredit when thinking about going back to work or increasing their hours. \\n3.55 The government will also increase support for parents on Universal Credit who \\nface the highest childcare costs, often because they are working longer hours, by \\nincreasing the Universal Credit childcare cost maximum amounts to £951 for 1 child \\nand £1,630 for 2 children.\\nPilots and evaluations\\n3.56 To deal with the significant economic challenge of inactivity, the government \\nis deploying a wide range of policy interventions, including some which are \\ninnovative. The government is committed to monitoring delivery and evaluating \\nthe effectiveness of these interventions, to ensure efforts are focused on what \\nworks, and so the OBR have the evidence to underpin the labour supply impacts \\nin their future forecasts.

Attending \\nearly years settings has a positive impact on children’s future success in education \\nand in the labour market.103 As outlined above, government is lowering the age \\nat which children of working parents can access free childcare and making the \\nchildcare support for parents on Universal Credit more accessible and generous. \\nAn early start in early years education benefits children and spending more hours \\nin early education between age 2 and 3 has immediate positive impacts, including \\nmore prosocial behaviour, fewer emotional symptoms and peer problems.104, 105 \\n3.59 Long-term investment in human capital is crucial for growth and productivity \\nand for maintaining the UK’s international competitiveness. Investing in education \\nand skills means people can perform more, and more complex, tasks, boosting \\ntheir chances of success in the labour market. Increasing skills is vital for boosting \\nproductivity: changes in labour quality contributed to around 15% of growth in \\nlabour productivity between 2001 and 2007 before the Global Financial Crisis, and \\nthe majority of labour productivity growth in the years after.106 \\n3.60 The UK has risen nearly 10 places in the global school league tables for maths \\nand reading since 2015 alone and has a strong foundation of advanced skills and \\na number of world-class universities.107 However, the UK lags behind international \\ncomparators on technical and basic adult skills. This is why the government is \\nmaking numeracy a central objective of our education system, right up to 18, and \\nis continuing to invest in high quality technical education, incentivising businesses \\nand individuals to invest in skills in England by delivering T Levels, approving Higher \\nTechnical Qualifications and rolling out Skills Bootcamps.\\n3.61 The government will introduce the Lifelong Loan Entitlement in England \\nfrom 2025, which will have a transformative impact on post-18 study, giving people \\nthe opportunity to study, retrain and upskill flexibly throughout their working \\nlives.

This will continue multi-\\nagency support to vulnerable children in alternative provision schools, to improve \\nengagement with education (including attendance, behaviour and wellbeing) and \\nreduce their vulnerability to serious violence. \\n3.64 As the country adapts to working for longer, the government is committing \\nto upskilling and retraining workers of all ages. Returnerships are a new offer \\ntargeted at the over 50s, which bring together the government’s existing skills \\nprogrammes, focusing on flexibility and previous experience to reduce training \\nlength. Returnerships will promote accelerated apprenticeships, Sector-Based \\nWork Academy Programme placements and Skills Bootcamps to the over 50s. This \\nwill support better access to re-training and allow workers of all ages to engage \\nwith the opportunities of a second career. This will be supported by £63 million for \\nan additional 8,000 Skills Bootcamps places in 2024-25 in England, and 40,000 new \\nSector-Based Work Academy Programme placements across 2023-24 and 2024-25 \\nin England and Scotland.\\n3.65 Since March 2022, over 165,000 Ukrainians have been welcomed to the \\nUK through the Ukraine Visa Schemes.108 While a large number of adults who \\nhave arrived through the schemes are now employed in the UK, 56% of arrivals \\nrecently surveyed, who have faced difficulty finding work, reported limited English \\nlanguage skills as an ongoing barrier to taking up work or moving into roles more \\nsuited to their skills and qualifications.109 \\n3.66 In an extension of the government’s support for Ukrainians fleeing the war \\nwho have arrived in the UK under the Ukraine Visa Schemes, the government is \\nproviding £11.5 million to offer intensive English language courses and employment \\nsupport to up to 10,000 individuals.

NPV \\nmeasures the value of tax relief today, reflecting that relief upfront is better than \\nrelief later. Capital allowances allow businesses to write off the cost of qualifying \\nexpenditure against taxable income, thus cutting businesses’ overall tax bill. \\nThis means that until April 2026, for every £1 invested in qualifying expenditure, \\ncompanies can save up to 25p on their tax bill. 59 Spring Budget 2023Chart 3.2: Headline Corporation Tax rates, G7 countries, 2022\\nSource: Based on OECD 2022 data taking into account national as well as sub national \\nrates of Corporation Tax and surcharges https://stats.oecd.org/indes.aspx?

The decision in the autumn \\nto permanently set the Annual Investment Allowance at £1 million, means 99% \\nof businesses receive 100% tax relief on their qualifying plant and machinery \\ninvestments in the year of investment.\\n3.71 In 2021, the government introduced the super-deduction to go further \\nto encourage companies to invest. This was due to end on 31 March 2023. The \\ngovernment is now introducing full expensing, a 100% First Year Allowance, from \\n1 April 2023 until 31 March 2026. This means that companies across the UK will \\nbe able to write off the full cost of qualifying main rate plant and machinery \\ninvestment in the year of investment. Companies investing in special rate \\n(including long life) assets will also benefit from a 50% first-year allowance during \\nthis period.

This means that the UK’s R&D tax relief for \\nlarge companies has the joint highest uncapped headline rate in the G7.111   \\n3.75 The government also committed to considering the case for further support \\nfor R&D intensive SMEs. From 1 April 2023, the government will introduce an \\nincreased rate of relief for loss-making R&D intensive Small and Medium size \\nEnterprises (SMEs). Eligible companies will receive £27 from HMRC for every \\n£100 of R&D investment. The government remains committed to supporting \\nR&D, and recognises the important role that R&D and innovation play for the \\neconomy and society. \\n3.76 The government will continue to support the UK’s world-leading creative \\nindustries by reforming the audiovisual tax reliefs into expenditure credits with a \\nhigher rate of relief than under the current system. The expenditure threshold for \\nhigh-end TV will remain at £1 million per hour. The government will also extend the \\ntemporary higher rates of theatre, orchestra, and museums and galleries tax reliefs \\nfor 2 further years from April 2023.\\n3.77 The government also continues to recognise the importance of the UK’s \\nworld-leading shipping and maritime services industries. From June 2023, for the \\nfirst time in nearly 18 years, the government will open an election window to permit \\nshipping companies that left the Tonnage Tax regime to return to the UK, bringing \\nwith them investment and jobs. This follows reforms to the regime announced at \\nAutumn Budget 2021, which aimed to increase the number of firms headquartered \\nin the UK, following the UK’s departure from the EU.\\n3.78 Spring Budget also announces a range of measures to simplify customs \\nprocesses, taking advantage of new freedoms following EU Exit. They will \\nsupport the UK’s competitiveness and promote economic growth by making \\nimporting and exporting as easy as possible for traders, complementing \\nwider transformational changes at the border that the government has \\ncommitted to delivering.\\n111 Measuring tax support for R&D and Innovation,  2021.62 Spring Budget 2023Box 3.C Tax simplification \\nThe government wants the tax system to be simple, fair and to support growth. \\nSimplifying the tax system reduces the time and money businesses and \\nindividuals spend on tax administration, helps boost productivity and supports \\ngrowth.\\xa0Progress towards these principles can often align, but sometimes there \\nare trade-offs to consider between them.\\nFollowing the closure of the Office of Tax Simplification, officials were given a \\nclear mandate to focus on simplicity of tax policy design throughout the policy \\nmaking process and on simplifying existing tax rules and administration. The \\ngovernment has increased direct engagement with business organisations \\nand tax professionals to better understand where problems for businesses and \\nindividuals arise, building on existing HMRC evidence and insight. New policy, \\nas well as existing tax rules, will be subject to increased scrutiny to ensure new \\nchanges are as easy to administer as possible. The Budget announces a number \\nof consultations which build on this approach, including on customs processes.\\nThe government is focused on ensuring that meeting tax obligations is as \\nstraightforward as possible at key events for a growing business, such as when \\na business is set up or takes on a first employee. Small businesses account for \\nalmost half of employment and around a third of turnover in the UK’s private \\nsector.112 As a first step, Spring Budget announces a consultation to expand the \\n‘cash basis’ – a simplified way for over four million sole traders to calculate and pay \\ntheir Income Tax - and a systematic review of HMRC guidance and key forms for \\nsmall businesses, to ensure the tax system is easy for them to understand.\\nFor small businesses not applying the cash basis, the Annual Investment \\nAllowance (AIA) provides 100% first-year relief for plant and machinery \\ninvestments. From April 2023, this will be permanently set at £1 million, \\nsimplifying the tax treatment of capital expenditure for 99% of businesses. Larger \\nbusinesses will benefit from full expensing for the next three years, simplifying \\nclaims and investment decisions. \\nFor individuals Spring Budget also simplifies pension tax. Increasing the Annual \\nAllowance and removing the Lifetime Allowance charge will reduce the number \\nof taxpayers that need to report and pay pensions tax.\\nSpring Budget also includes a discussion document on modernising HMRC’s \\nIncome Tax services so taxpayers can quickly and easily manage their own \\ntax affairs online, reducing the need to contact HMRC. This builds on the \\ngovernment’s commitment to make HMRC services simpler and more efficient, \\nfor example through introducing a Single Customer Account so taxpayers can \\ninteract with all their tax information in one place.\\nTax simplification is an ongoing priority for the government and will be kept at \\nthe core of the policy development process as tax and administration changes are \\nconsidered for future fiscal events.\\n112 Gov.uk business population estimates , 2022.63 Spring Budget 2023High growth sectors\\n3.79 The government will turn its vision for UK enterprise into a reality by \\nsupporting growth in the sectors of the future. There are opportunities to \\naccelerate the progress of the technologies that will define this century \\nby encouraging investment and smarter regulation. This will support the \\ngovernment’s aim to capture a share of growing global markets in:\\n• green industries \\n• digital technologies\\n• life sciences \\n• creative industries \\n• advanced manufacturing.\\n3.80 At Autumn Statement 2022, the government asked Sir Patrick Vallance to \\nlead the Pro-Innovation Regulation of Technologies Review to support innovation \\nin key growth sectors. Sir Patrick publishes his report today on the regulation \\nof emerging digital technologies and he makes interim recommendations on \\nlife sciences. Green industries will be addressed in the coming weeks. The new \\nGovernment Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Dame Angela McLean, will oversee \\nforthcoming reviews into creative industries and advanced manufacturing.\\n3.81 Recognising the importance of regulator behaviours for promoting growth, \\nthe government has asked Sir Patrick Vallance to report on how regulators can \\nbetter support innovation. Additionally, the government will ask Professor Dame \\nAngela McLean, to look at the regulator Growth Duty. Recommendations on these \\ncross-cutting regulatory issues, and a government response, will be published by \\nthe summer. This work will also inform the Department of Business and Trade’s \\nupcoming consultation on economic regulators.\\n3.82 Cutting-edge companies across these high growth sectors need access to \\nsufficient finance to be able to start, scale and stay in the UK. Since the Patient \\nCapital Review in 2017, the government has delivered a series of reforms to \\nincrease investment into innovative scale-up companies, and the UK’s venture \\ncapital financing gap with the US has halved. To develop the next generation \\nof globally competitive companies that grow and list in the UK, and to bolster \\nthe retirement incomes of millions of ordinary people, it will be critical to unlock \\ndefined contribution (DC) pension fund investment into the UK’s innovative firms. \\nThe government has already taken important steps to address barriers and to \\naccelerate progress further. The government will work closely with industry and \\nregulators to bring forward an ambitious package of measures by the autumn. The \\nSpring Budget signals the government’s ambition with an initial package:\\n• Increasing support for the UK’s most innovative companies by extending \\nthe British Patient Capital programme for a further 10 years until 2033-\\n34 and increasing its focus on R&D intensive industries, providing at least \\n£3 billion in investment.64 Spring Budget 2023• Spurring the creation of new vehicles for investment into science and tech \\ncompanies, tailored to the needs of UK DC pension schemes, through a new \\nLong-term Investment for Technology and Science (LIFTS) initiative. At Spring \\nBudget, the government is inviting feedback on the design of the competition.\\n• Leading by example by pursuing accelerated transfer of the £364 billion \\nLocal Government Pension Scheme assets into pools to support increased \\ninvestment in innovative companies and other productive assets. The \\ngovernment will shortly come forward with a consultation.\\nGreen industries\\n3.83 The transition to net zero is essential to long-term prosperity. The UK \\nwelcomes decisive international action to tackle climate change and has a world-\\nleading track record in reducing emissions, innovating in green technologies, and \\nmobilising finance for the transition.113 In addition to the measures in the Spring \\nBudget, the government will set out further action later this month to ensure \\nenergy security in the UK and meet our net zero commitments. \\n3.84 The invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the need for energy security. Clean \\nenergy will be vital for both our security and net zero goals, and presents an \\nopportunity for growth. The government is therefore boosting longer-term public \\nand private investment to ensure the country’s energy system is secure and clean, \\nand to help meet the government’s 2050 net zero commitment.\\n3.85 To further leverage private investment into the UK’s secure and clean \\nenergy future, the government is launching Great British Nuclear (GBN) to \\naddress constraints in the nuclear market and support new nuclear builds as the \\ngovernment works towards net zero. GBN will launch the first staged competition \\nfor Small Modular Reactors, which is expected to attract the best designs from \\nboth domestic and international vendors. The government’s ambition is to select \\nthe leading technologies by the end of this year and if demonstrated to be viable, \\nco-fund this exciting new technology in the UK.\\n3.86 While the initial focus of GBN will be on Small Modular Reactors, further large \\nGigawatt-scale projects will also be considered subject to value for money, relevant \\napprovals and technology readiness and maturity, to help deliver net zero. Nuclear \\nenergy will also be included in the green taxonomy, subject to consultation, \\nencouraging private investment. This package is essential for the transition to net \\nzero and confirms the government’s support for the growth of these critical green \\nindustries in the UK. \\n3.87 To support energy efficiency, the government will extend the Climate Change \\nAgreement scheme for a further 2 years. \\n3.88 The government will also provide up to £20 billion funding for early \\ndeployment of Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS), to help meet the \\ngovernment’s climate commitments. This unprecedented level of funding for the \\n113 The Low Carbon Economy Index 2019 , PwC, 2019.65 Spring Budget 2023sector will unlock private investment and job creation across the UK, particularly \\non the East Coast and in the North West of England and North Wales. It will also \\nkick-start the delivery of subsequent phases of this new sustainable industry in the \\nUK, taking advantage of the country’s natural comparative advantage in CCUS. \\nA shortlist of projects for the first phase of CCUS deployment will be announced \\nlater this month. Further projects will be able to enter a selection process for Track \\n1 expansion launching this year, and 2 additional clusters will be selected through a \\nTrack 2 process, with details announced shortly. \\nDigital technologies \\n3.89 The government welcomes Sir Patrick Vallance’s first published report \\ninto the regulation of emerging digital technologies and accepts all of its \\nrecommendations. A supplementary Spring Budget document sets out how they \\nwill be implemented.\\n3.90 The UK has long been a leading location for digital and technology companies \\nto innovate and do business. However, this report highlights that there are areas \\nwhere the government can further ensure that the UK’s regulatory environment \\nenables innovation and a thriving digital economy. From better regulating \\nthe applications of AI, to promoting openness of public data and accelerating \\nlegislation to bring forward the future of transport, Sir Patrick’s report presents \\nambitious ideas to unlock progress.\\n3.91 Further investment is needed in infrastructure for research and innovation. \\nPowerful computing capability is an essential component of being a global hub for \\ninnovation and achieving the UK’s ambition to be a science superpower. Compute \\nis also essential to progress in Artificial Intelligence research.114 However, according \\nto the independent Future of Compute Review, published last week, the UK’s most \\npowerful computer ranks just 28th in the world.115 The Review also found that the \\nUK’s AI community has immediate requirements for large-scale, accelerator-driven \\ncompute to remain internationally competitive. \\n3.92 In line with two of the key recommendations of the Future of Compute \\nReview, the government will invest, subject to the usual business case processes, \\nin the region of £900 million to build an exascale supercomputer and to establish \\na new AI Research Resource, with initial investments starting this year.116 Together, \\nthese will provide significant compute capacity to our AI community and \\nprovide scientists with access to cutting-edge computing power. They will allow \\nresearchers to better understand climate change, power the discovery of new \\ndrugs and maximise our potential in AI. \\n114 “Compute” refers to computer systems where processing power, memory, data storage and network are \\nassembled at scale to tackle computational tasks beyond the capabilities of everyday computers.\\n115 Independent Review of the Future of Compute , 2023.\\n116 “Exascale” refers to a high-performance computing system that is capable of at least one exaflop per second (this \\nis a measure of computing performance), The exascale system will be several times more powerful than the UK’s \\nexisting top supercomputers.66 Spring Budget 20233.93  Recent developments in AI, such as the launch of ChatGPT and the \\nannouncement of Google Bard, have shown the powerful potential for \\ntechnologies which are based upon foundation models, including large language \\nmodels. As announced alongside the refresh of the Integrated Review, government \\nwill establish a taskforce to advance UK sovereign capability in foundation models, \\nincluding large language models, and provide direct advice to ministers, to ensure \\nthat the UK is at the forefront of this technology. \\n3.94 The government will award a £1 million prize every year for the next 10 years to \\nresearchers that drive progress in critical areas of AI.\\n3.95 Quantum technologies are expected to have transformative and wide-\\nranging impacts, through the development of new types of computers, secure \\ncommunications, and wider improvements to sensing, imaging and timing. \\nThe Quantum Strategy sets out a new and ambitious quantum research and \\ninnovation programme. The government will invest a total of £2.5 billion over 10 \\nyears, focusing on realising 4 goals: ensuring the UK is home to world-leading \\nquantum science and engineering; supporting businesses through innovation \\nfunding opportunities and by providing access to world-leading R&D facilities; \\ndriving the use of quantum technologies in the UK; and creating a national and \\ninternational regulatory framework. \\n3.96 The government has allocated £100 million funding for the Innovation \\nAccelerators programme to 26 transformative R&D projects. This will accelerate \\nthe growth of 3 high-potential innovation clusters and support Levelling Up. \\nThis includes the Manchester Turing Innovation Hub led by the University of \\nManchester, 2 quantum projects in Glasgow led by the University of Glasgow and \\nM-Squared Lasers Limited, and a project to accelerate new health and medical \\ntechnologies led by the University of Birmingham.\\n3.97 The government has committed to lead on the regulation of AI and on the \\nfuture of web technology, sometimes known as Web 3 or the Metaverse. The \\ngovernment will work to maximise the potential of Web3 and spur UK growth and \\ninnovation, alongside empowering individuals to influence how their data is used, \\nand managing downside risks to privacy, security and harms.\\nLife sciences\\n3.98 The UK is a world-leader in the life sciences industry, with significant R&D \\nhubs such as Cambridge’s Biomedical Campus. East West Rail – the rail line joining \\nOxford and Cambridge - will support further growth in life sciences and other \\nhigh-productivity sectors across the region, connecting businesses and talent. \\nIn May, the government will confirm the route for the new Bedford-Cambridge \\nsection, and will provide capacity funding to support local authorities to develop \\ntheir plans for strategic economic growth around new stations.\\n3.99 Boosting the supply of commercial development, in particular lab space, is \\nkey to supporting R&D needs and driving investment into high value industries \\nacross England, such as the life sciences and advanced manufacturing sectors 67 Spring Budget 2023in the Oxford-Cambridge corridor. Following the recent National Planning Policy \\nFramework consultation the government will set out further details for supporting \\ngrowth in this area in due course.\\n3.100 Based on interim recommendations from Sir Patrick’s regulatory review \\nof life sciences, the government is supporting the Medicines and Healthcare \\nproducts Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the first drugs regulator in the world to \\nauthorise a COVID-19 vaccine, to become faster and nimbler. With £10 million \\nextra funding over the next 2 years, the MHRA will maximise its use of Brexit \\nfreedoms and accelerate patient access to treatments. The MHRA is exploring \\npartnerships with trusted international agencies, such as in the US, Europe and \\nJapan, to provide simple, rapid approvals for medicines and technologies that have \\nreceived their approval from 2024. The MHRA will also have a fully operational swift \\napproval process in place from 2024 for the most impactful new medicines and \\ntechnologies - such as cancer vaccines and AI therapeutics for mental health. \\nCreative industries and advanced manufacturing\\n3.101 Further policy announcements will follow for these sectors once the \\nrecommendations from their subsequent reviews have been considered. \\nSpreading opportunity Everywhere \\n3.102 Opportunity is spread unequally across the UK. The government is \\ncommitted to challenging and reversing that unfairness by ensuring the benefits \\nof economic development are felt by people everywhere, whether in towns, cities, \\nrural or coastal areas. \\n3.103 The growth of every place and nation in the UK is vital, not just to boost \\nnational economic growth, but to create a stronger, fairer and more inclusive \\nsociety. The Centre for Cities estimates that the UK’s regional economic inequalities \\nrepresent £83 billion of lost output – more than 4% of GDP.117 The UK is at its best \\nwhen it can draw from the combined talent and strength of its regions and \\nnations. Empowered local decision-making, civic entrepreneurship and local wealth \\ncreation lead to better outcomes for businesses and citizens across the country.\\n3.104 The UK’s second cities should be engines for growth for their surrounding \\ntowns and regions, but they are held back by poor connectivity and skills disparities. \\nIf the UK’s second cities were as productive relative to the national average as those \\nin the G7 then UK GDP would be nearly 5% higher, and would bring the UK second \\nonly to the US and Germany for GDP per head.118 \\n3.105 The February 2022 Levelling Up White Paper set out a powerful case for \\nchange and a clear plan of action. The Spring Budget drives this ambitious agenda \\nforward, delivering change for all parts of the UK with UK-wide support, targeted \\nspending to meet local needs, and devolution to give local leaders the tools they \\nneed to drive change in their areas.\\n117 ‘So you want to level up? ’, Centre for Cities, 2021.\\n118 HMT calculation using OECD Regions and Cities data.68 Spring Budget 2023Levelling up by attracting new private sector investment\\n3.106 The government is launching the refocused Investment Zones programme \\nto catalyse 12 high-potential knowledge-intensive growth clusters across the UK, \\nincluding 4 across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each cluster will drive \\nthe growth of at least one of our key future sectors - green industries, digital \\ntechnologies, life sciences, creative industries and advanced manufacturing - \\nbringing investment into areas which have underperformed economically. \\n3.107 Each English Investment Zone will have access to interventions worth \\n£80 million over 5 years. Local government and research institutions will be able to \\ntailor their Investment Zone plan to their local circumstances. \\n3.108 Investment Zones will have access to a single 5 year tax offer matching \\nthat in Freeports, consisting of enhanced rates of Capital Allowance, Structures \\nand Buildings Allowance, and relief from Stamp Duty Land Tax, Business Rates \\nand Employer National Insurance Contributions. Alongside this, Investment \\nZones will have access to flexible grant funding to support skills and incentivise \\napprenticeships, provide specialist business support and improve local \\ninfrastructure, dependent on local requirements. Local partners will be able to \\nchoose the number and size of tax sites, within the £80 million envelope, up to \\na maximum of 3 sites totalling 600 hectares. The amount of grant funding will \\ndepend on the number and size of tax sites. \\n3.109 To access this offer, plans must credibly set out how local partners will use \\nthe levers available to propel growth in priority sectors, identify private sector \\nmatch funding, and use the local planning system to support growth. Plans will \\nbe developed collaboratively by Mayoral Combined Authorities (MCAs) – working \\nin partnership with local universities, councils and businesses – and central \\ngovernment. Plans will need to demonstrate how the Investment Zone will support \\nthe UK reaching net zero by 2050 and the government’s new long-term targets \\nto protect and enhance the natural environment, and be resilient to the effects of \\nclimate change.\\n3.110 Local partners within the geographies covered by the following authorities \\nwill be invited to begin discussions on hosting an Investment Zone with the \\nDepartment for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) and HM \\nTreasury, with a view to agreeing Investment Zone proposals by the end of the \\nyear. These locations have been shortlisted through a robust analytical assessment, \\nwhich accounted for strengths in innovation, productivity potential and levelling \\nup need, alongside other factors considered essential for an Investment Zone to be \\nsuccessful, such as strong governance: \\n• the proposed East Midlands Mayoral Combined County Authority\\n• Greater Manchester Mayoral Combined Authority\\n• Liverpool City Region Mayoral Combined Authority\\n• the proposed North East Mayoral Combined Authority\\n• South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority69 Spring Budget 2023• Tees Valley Mayoral Combined Authority\\n• West Midlands Mayoral Combined Authority\\n• West Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority.\\n3.111 Proposals will be led by the MCA or, where the MCA is not yet confirmed, an \\ninterim accountable body will be agreed. This shortlist will remain under review, \\nwith scope for future discussions with other areas.\\n3.112 The government has published a policy prospectus which sets out further \\ndetails on the programme, including the policy framework for the programme in \\nEngland. DLUHC have also published the selection methodology for England. \\n3.113 DLUHC is working closely with the devolved administrations to establish how \\nInvestment Zones in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be delivered. The \\nfinal design choices and agreement on an Investment Zone in Northern Ireland will \\nbe subject to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive.\\nEmpowering local leadership \\n3.114 The Spring Budget delivers on the Levelling Up White Paper by providing \\nnew and deeper powers to more local leaders, so that they can act more flexibly \\nand innovatively, respond to local need and drive growth for their citizens. \\n3.115 In the Levelling Up White Paper, the government committed to negotiate \\ntrailblazer deeper devolution deals with the Greater Manchester and West Midlands \\nCombined Authorities to set the blueprint for deeper devolution across the rest \\nof England. These deals have now been agreed, subject to ratification, and will \\nequip these authorities with deeper and additional policy levers to deliver on their \\npriorities, including across local transport, employment, housing, innovation and \\nnet zero. This includes a greater role in simplifying and integrating ticketing in local \\ntransport systems; devolution of the majority of 19+ adult skills funding to mayors; a \\nlong-term commitment to local authorities retaining 100% of their business rates; \\nand, for the first time outside of London, local leaders will now be able to set the \\nstrategic direction over the Affordable Housing Programme in their areas.70 Spring Budget 20233.116 As part of the trailblazer deeper devolution deals, the government has \\ncommitted to give Greater Manchester and West Midlands Combined Authorities \\nsingle multi-year funding settlements at the next Spending Review. These \\nsettlements will be agreed directly with government through a single process and \\nwill cover their funding for devolved policy areas, including local growth and place, \\nlocal transport, housing and regeneration, adult skills and retrofitting buildings to \\ndrive decarbonisation, for the duration of each Spending Review period. The single \\nfunding settlements will give the trailblazer MCAs the flexibility and independence \\nthey need to deliver for their areas while providing assurance of MCA performance \\nthrough a single outcomes-based accountability framework. The government’s \\nambition is to roll this model out to all areas in England with a devolution deal and \\na directly elected leader over time.\\n3.117 As part of our commitment to devolution, the government intends to expand \\nthe local retention of business rates to more areas in the next Parliament and will \\nwork closely with interested councils to achieve this. The government also remains \\ncommitted to bringing forward wider proposals to improve the local government \\nfinance landscape in the next Parliament.\\n3.118 Last year, the government made significant progress towards its 2030 \\ndevolution mission, signing 6 devolution deals. The government is fully committed \\nto these deals and seeing the first elections in May 2024. The government’s \\nambition is to see devolution extended further across England, beyond the areas \\nnamed in the Levelling Up White Paper. In taking forward this ambition the \\ngovernment will seek to negotiate a new wave of devolution deals over the coming \\nyear, which will include local investment funding for areas that are committed to a \\nmayor or directly elected leader.\\n3.119 The government is committed to empowering democratically elected local \\nleaders at every opportunity. To this end, the government intends for the functions \\nof Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) to be delivered by local government in the \\nfuture. Therefore, the government is minded to withdraw central government \\nsupport for LEPs from April 2024. DLUHC and the Department for Business \\nand Trade will now consult on these proposals, before confirming a decision. \\nThe government will publish an updated policy position to confirm next steps \\nby the summer. \\n3.120 At Autumn Budget 2021, the government announced an unprecedented \\ninvestment package of £5.7 billion for 8 English city regions to transform their local \\ntransport networks between 2022-23 and 2026-27. The City Region Sustainable \\nTransport Settlements increase the devolved powers of MCAs and aim to improve \\nsustainability. Spring Budget announces that the government is committing \\n£8.8 billion for a second round of the programme covering 2027-28 to 2031-32, with \\nfunding for Greater Manchester and the West Midlands to be included in their \\nSingle Settlements.71 Spring Budget 2023Levelling up with high quality regeneration across the UK \\n3.121 The Spring Budget confirms hundreds of millions in targeted funding to \\nregenerate local areas, from rolling out innovative new partnerships to support the \\nmost left-behind areas, to unlocking investment and local growth with additional \\nfunding for projects up and down the country.\\n3.122 The Spring Budget announces the rollout of new Levelling Up Partnerships, \\nproviding over £400 million and bringing the collective power of government to \\nprovide bespoke place-based regeneration in 20 of England’s areas most in need of \\nlevelling up over 2023 and 2024-25. The government will ensure a fair geographic \\nspread across the regions of England, including: City of Kingston upon Hull, \\nSandwell, Mansfield, Middlesbrough, Blackburn with Darwen, Hastings, Torbay, \\nTendring, Stoke-on-Trent, Boston, Redcar and Cleveland, Wakefield, Oldham, \\nRother, Torridge, Walsall, Doncaster, South Tyneside, Rochdale, and Bassetlaw. \\nApportionment of this investment will be made on a case-by-case basis, and in \\neach of these places, the government will work with local leaders and mayors in \\ncouncils and combined authorities, local businesses from all sectors, community \\norganisations and residents to identify and address the biggest barriers \\nto levelling up.\\n3.123 A third round of the Levelling Up Fund will proceed as planned later in 2023 \\nwith a further £1 billion to level up places across the UK.\\n3.124 The Budget also announces over £200 million for 16 regeneration projects in \\nEngland. These projects have been assessed as high quality and will commence \\ndelivery later this year. Investment has been targeted towards the left-behind \\nplaces in the Levelling Up White Paper or projects that are under £10 million to \\nensure quick delivery and a good spread of funding across England.\\xa0All funding is \\nsubject to final subsidy checks. Projects include:\\n• £6.6 million in Wigan\\n• £8 million in Blackpool\\n• £6.7 million in Tendring\\n• £5.6 million in Kirklees\\n• £9.8 million in Telford and Wrekin\\n• £5.4 million in Salford\\n• £8.4 million in Waltham Forest\\n• £4.3 million in East Suffolk\\n• £20 million in Sandwell\\n• £20 million in Redcar and Cleveland\\n• £19.9 million in Tameside\\n• £20 million in Blackburn with Darwen\\n• £20 million in Wolverhampton\\n• £16.4 million in Northumberland72 Spring Budget 2023• £20 million in Rotherham\\n• £20 million in North East Lincolnshire.\\n3.125 £58 million will be invested in 3 levelling up capital projects in the North West \\nof England. This will see a new community hub in Stockport, the transformation \\nof Bootle town centre, and the redevelopment of markets as well as transport \\nconnectivity improvements in Rossendale.\\n3.126 The government has also provided a further £161 million for high-value capital \\nregeneration projects in city regions across England, including business premises \\nand food science facilities in Tees Valley, and unlocking investment in a research \\ncampus in the Liverpool City Region.\\n3.127 The existing £150 million Community Ownership Fund provides funding \\nto areas across the UK to allow community groups to take ownership of assets \\nat risk of closure. The Spring Budget announces funding for an additional 30 \\nprojects, meaning almost 100 communities across the UK have taken ownership of \\nvital local assets. \\n3.128 The government will provide up to £8.6 million for Scotland’s festival \\neconomy. Funding could help build a permanent headquarters for the Edinburgh \\nFringe Festival and create year-round opportunities for local artists and talent \\nacross Edinburgh festivals. This will boost Scotland’s festival economy, which \\ncontributes over £300 million a year to Scotland. \\n3.129 The government has allocated\\xa0up to £40 million to widening participation \\nin further and higher education in Northern Ireland. \\xa0The government will also \\nprovide up to\\xa0£3 million to extend the Tackling Paramilitarism Programme, \\nenabling the programme to continue its positive work to tackle paramilitarism in \\nNorthern Ireland and strengthen community resilience. \\n3.130 To support the restoration of the historic grade 2 listed Holyhead Breakwater \\nat Holyhead Port, the government is providing £20 million of funding to the Welsh \\nGovernment. This will ensure the long-term viability of this vital transport hub and \\ntrade links with the island of Ireland, as well as safeguard the hundreds of jobs this \\nport supports in Wales. \\nEnsuring a sustainable and accessible housing market and \\ndriving infrastructure investment and delivery\\n3.131 At the 2021 Spending Review, the government demonstrated its commitment \\nto investing in safe and affordable housing by confirming a settlement of \\nnearly £24 billion. \\n3.132 High levels of nutrient pollution in protected sites are stalling housing \\ndelivery across 74 Local Planning Authorities, reflecting a major barrier to the \\ngovernment’s ambition of delivering 300,000 homes per year. The government has \\nalready provided significant support for protected sites that are affected, both to \\naddress the pollution at source and to support housing developers to deliver their \\nenvironmental obligations. 73 Spring Budget 20233.133 In recognition of the scale of the impact, the Spring Budget announces \\nfurther support to ensure ‘nutrient neutrality’ obligations can be efficiently \\ndelivered, thereby reducing the risks facing developers building homes in affected \\nareas. DLUHC will shortly launch a call for evidence from Local Planning Authorities, \\nbacked by a commitment to provide funding for high quality, locally -led nutrient \\nmitigation schemes. \\n3.134 The government is committed to delivering high quality infrastructure to \\nboost growth across the country, including over £600 billion public sector gross \\ninvestment over the next five years, split across economic and social infrastructure. \\nThe government will publish an updated National Infrastructure and Construction \\nPipeline later in 2023, reflecting this commitment. \\n3.135 In addition, to boost infrastructure investment that is crucial to local \\ncommunities and businesses, the government will invest a further £200 million \\nin 2023-24 to maintain and improve local roads. This increase will enable local \\nauthorities in England to fix more potholes, complete resurfacing, and invest \\nin major repairs and renewals, such as keeping bridges and major structures \\nopen. Better roads enable faster and safer journeys for all users, contributing to \\nproductivity gains. The increase is expected to fix the equivalent of up to 4 million \\nadditional potholes across the country. \\n3.136 Now in its final stages in Parliament, the UK Infrastructure Bank Bill will \\ngive the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) the powers to deliver on its mandate to \\naccelerate investment into ambitious infrastructure projects which tackle climate \\nchange and support levelling up. Since its launch in June 2021 the UKIB has \\ncompleted 10 deals worth over £1 billion, investing in projects that support people, \\nbusinesses and communities across the UK.\\n3.137 The government has published an Action Plan, supported by £15 million \\nfunding over 2023-24, setting out reforms to the Nationally Significant \\nInfrastructure Project (NSIP) planning process. These reforms will deliver a more \\nsustainable system, greater certainty for investors, and will ensure that projects \\nof this scale put environmental and community benefits at the heart of delivery. \\nNational Policy Statements (NPSs) are a cornerstone of the NSIP regime and as \\npart of the Action Plan, the government has now published a consultation on the \\nNational Networks NPS. A consultation on the updated Energy NPS and the final \\nWater NPS will be published shortly. \\n3.138 In addition, the government has asked the National Infrastructure \\nCommission (NIC) to carry out a study to look at the role of NPSs and make \\nrecommendations on how these important documents can support our reforms, \\nincluding what action the government can take to ensure NPSs are reviewed more \\nregularly and how the process could be improved. The NIC will provide a final \\nreport in spring 2023.74 Spring Budget 202375 Spring Budget 20234 Policy Decisions \\n4.1 The following chapter sets out all Spring Budget 2023 policy decisions. Unless \\nstated otherwise, the decisions set out are ones which are announced at the \\nBudget. Table 4.1 shows the cost or yield of all government decisions accounted \\nfor at Spring Budget 2023 which have a direct effect on Public Sector Net \\nBorrowing (PSNB) in the years up to 2027-28.

Further details can be found in the ‘Debt management report 2023-24’, \\navailable at gov.uk.\\nDebt management objective\\nA.2 The debt management objective, as set out in the Debt management report \\n2023-24, is “to minimise, over the long term, the costs of meeting the government’s \\nfinancing needs, taking into account risk, while ensuring that debt management \\npolicy is consistent with the aims of the monetary policy”.\\nDebt management policy\\nA.3 While decisions on debt management policy must be taken with a long-\\nterm perspective, specific decisions on funding the government’s gross financing \\nrequirement are taken annually. Those decisions are announced before the start \\nof the forthcoming financial year and are typically updated in April (a technical \\nadjustment to reflect outturn data from the previous year) and as the Office for \\nBudget Responsibility (OBR) publishes subsequent fiscal projections. \\nFinancing arithmetic\\nA.4 The financing arithmetic for 2023-24 is set out in Table A.1.\\nA.5 The OBR’s March 2023 forecast for the 2023-24 central government net cash \\nrequirement (excluding NRAM ltd, Bradford & Bingley, and Network Rail), which \\nis referred to as CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR), is £159.5 billion. This measure is \\nused in the financing arithmetic as it reflects the forecast cash requirement of \\nthe Exchequer. \\nA.6 The net financing requirement (NFR) for the Debt Management Office (DMO) \\ncomprises: CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR) plus any financing for gilt redemptions, \\nand other adjustments, less the net contribution to financing from National \\nSavings and Investments (NS&I) and any other in-year contributions to financing. \\nA.7 The NFR for 2023-24 is forecast to be £246.1 billion, reflecting:\\n• the forecast for CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR) of £159.5 billion\\n• gilt redemptions of £117.0 billion \\n• a planned short-term financing adjustment of -£21.3 billion resulting from \\nunanticipated over funding in 2022-23\\n• a net contribution to financing from NS&I of £7.5 billion108 Spring Budget 2023• a net contribution to financing from other financing items of £1.5 billion.\\nA.8 As set out in Table A.1, the NFR for 2023-24 will primarily be met by gilt sales\\nof £241.1 billion. In addition, it is expected that Treasury bills will also make a net\\npositive contribution to debt financing in 2023-24 of £5.0 billion.\\nGilt issuance by method, type, and maturity\\nA.9 Decisions on the skew of gilt issuance are made annually with reference to\\nthe government’s debt management objective, as set out above, and in the Debtmanagement report 2023-24.\\nA.10 Auctions will remain the government’s primary method of gilt issuance. It is \\nanticipated that £202.1 billion (83.8%) of total gilt sales will take place by auction in 2023-24, and up to around £27.0 billion (11.2%) will take place by syndication. The \\ngovernment will continue to have the option to use gilt tenders to supplement \\nissuance by auction and syndication.\\nA.11 Issuance by auction and syndication is planned to be split by maturity and \\ntype as follows:\\n• £86.7 billion of short conventional gilts (36.0% of total issuance)\\n• £65.3 billion of medium conventional gilts (27.1% of total issuance)\\n(including green gilts)\\n• £50.9 billion of long conventional gilts (21.1% of total issuance)(including green gilts)\\n• £26.2 billion of index-linked gilts (10.9% of total issuance)\\nA.12 The financing plans of the DMO include an initially unallocated portion of \\nissuance through which gilts of any maturity or type may be issued, subject to prior \\nnotification. This unallocated portion will be initially set at £12.0 billion (5.0% of total \\nissuance) in 2023-24. The unallocated portion is used in such a way as to respond \\nappropriately to evolving market conditions in-year. 109 Spring Budget 2023Table A.1: Financing arithmetic in 2022-23 and 2023-24 (£ billion)1\\n2022-23 2023-24\\nCGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR)2115.4 159.5\\nGilt redemptions 107.1 117.0\\nFinancing adjustment carried forward from previous financial years3-33.1 -21.3\\nGross financing requirement 189.4 255.1\\nless:\\nNS&I net financing 6.1 7.5\\nNS&I Green Savings Bonds 0.5 -\\nOther financing41.4 1.5\\nNet financing requirement (NFR) for the Debt Management Office (DMO) 181.4 246.1\\nDMO's NFR will be financed through:\\nGilt sales, through sales of:\\nShort conventional gilts 66.5 86.7\\nMedium conventional gilts (including green gilts)544.6 65.3\\nLong conventional gilts (including green gilts)640.8 50.9\\nIndex-linked gilts 17.5 26.2\\nUnallocated amount of gilts 0.0 12.0\\nTotal gilt sales for debt financing 169.5 241.1\\nTotal net contribution of Treasury bills for debt financing 33.2 5.0\\nTotal financing 202.7 246.1\\nDMO net cash position 23.6 2.3\\n1 Figures may not sum due to rounding.\\n2 Central government net cash requirement (excluding NRAM ltd, Bradford & Bingley, and Network Rail).\\n3 The -£33.1 billion financing adjustment in 2022-23 carried forward from previous years reflects the 2021-22 \\noutturn for the CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR), as first published on 26 April 2022. The -£21.3 billion adjustment \\nin 2023-24 is the amount required to reduce the estimated DMO cash position at end-March 2024 to £2.3 billion.\\n4 This financing item is typically comprised of estimated income from coinage and unhedged reserves.\\n5 Including green gilt sales of £6.4 billion in 2022-23, and planned green gilt sales in 2023-24.\\n6 Including green gilt sales of £3.5 billion in 2022-23, and planned green gilt sales in 2023-24.\\nSource: Debt Management Office, HM Treasury, National Savings and Investments, and \\nOffice for Budget Responsibility.\\nIndex-linked gilts\\nA.13 As set out in the 2022-23 Debt management report, the government is no \\nlonger looking to reduce index-linked gilt issuance as a share of total issuance on \\na year-on-year basis over the medium term. The government decides index-linked \\ngilt issuance on an annual basis, and in practice the share of total issuance will vary \\nyear-to-year depending on factors including the size of the financing requirement, \\ndemand, and market conditions.119 \\nA.14  In the 2023-24 financing remit, planned index-linked gilt issuance accounts \\nfor 10.9% of total gilt issuance. It is higher in absolute terms than in 2022-23 but \\ngiven the elevated financing requirement in 2023-24, remains significantly lower as \\na proportion of total gilt issuance than in the years prior to 2018-19.\\n119  As is the case for conventional gilts of all maturity buckets, actual index-linked gilt issuance may differ from \\nplanned issuance due to transfers from the unallocated pot.110 Spring Budget 2023A.15 Decisions on the precise levels of index-linked and conventional gilt issuance \\nwill continue to be taken as part of the annual financing remit and in consultation \\nwith market participants.\\nGreen gilts and retail Green Savings Bonds\\nA.16 The UK Government issued its inaugural green gilt on 21 September 2021, \\nmarking the launch of the UK Government’s green financing programme. As \\nof 15 March 2023, the two green gilts currently in issue have been built up to \\n£18.5 billion (maturing in 2033) and £12.9 billion (maturing in 2053), respectively. All \\ngreen gilt proceeds are allocated against eligible green spend as defined in the UK \\nGovernment Green Financing Framework, available at gov.uk.\\nA.17 The government plans to issue £10.0 billion of green gilts in 2023-24, subject \\nto demand and market conditions. The expectation is that the focus will be on \\nfurther re-openings of the two existing green gilts, which will be kept under review \\ntaking into account market conditions. The planned green financing requirement \\nis derived from eligible green expenditure in the coming financial year.\\nA.18 The retail Green Savings Bonds (GSB) were brought on sale via the NS&I \\nwebsite on 22 October 2021, and this product has allowed UK savers to support \\nthe government’s green spending initiatives. As of February 2023, NS&I had raised \\n£0.5 billion from the GSB in the 2022-23 financial year and £0.8 billion since the \\ninitial October 2021 launch.\\nTreasury bills\\nA.19 Treasury bills for debt management purposes are forecast to constitute \\n£70.0 billion of the total debt stock at the end of 2022-23. It is currently anticipated \\nthat net issuance of Treasury bills for debt management purposes in 2023-24 will \\nbe £5.0 billion.\\nNS&I\\nA.20  NS&I will have a net financing target of £7.5 billion in 2023-24 (within a range \\nof ±£3.0 billion). This target reflects NS&I’s requirement to balance the interests of \\nits savers, the taxpayer, and the wider financial services sector.\\nIllustrative future gross financing requirement\\nA.21 Table A.2 sets out the illustrative gross financing requirement for each \\nfinancial year from 2024-25 to 2027-28, using the OBR March 2023 forecast \\nfor CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR) and taking into account current planned \\ngilt redemptions.111 Spring Budget 2023Table A.2: Illustrative gross financing requirement (£ billion)1\\n2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28\\nCGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR)2130.9 102.6 84.4 89.4\\nGilt redemptions 139.9 136.6 92.5 109.1\\nTotal illustrative gross financing requirement 270.8 239.2 176.9 198.5\\n1 Figures may not sum due to rounding.\\n2 Central government net cash requirement (excluding NRAM ltd, Bradford & Bingley, and Network Rail).\\nSource: Debt Management Office, HM Treasury, and Office for Budget Responsibility.112 Spring Budget 2023113 Spring Budget 2023BPublic sector receipts \\nand spending\\nB.1 Chart B.1 shows public sector receipts by main type.
